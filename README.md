html2presentation
=================

This tool was designed to summarize HTML version of the papers published in the divroceedings of CHI 96 - Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, 1996 : http://sigchi.org/chi96/proceedings/papers.htm
Since we've wriien a written a parser of our own to parse the HTML source, we realize that its not very generic and may not work for all the inputs apart from the ones in these proceedings.
Since this is just a Proof-Of-Concept application, don't expect too much of error handling. But we try to provide some basic error messages when something fails.
In any case, feel free to contact us for free hugs or bugs! :)
