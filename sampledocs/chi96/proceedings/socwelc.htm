<H1>From the ACM/SIGCHI Chair and Executive Vice-Chair </H1>

On behalf of the Executive Committee of ACM's Special Interest Group on
Computer-Human Interaction (ACM/SIGCHI), welcome to CHI 96, SIGCHI'S annual
conference on Human-Computer Interaction.  Each CHI conference offers a
snapshot of the HCI field as it grows and evolves, of the people who define
the HCI field, and of the people who collectively form SIGCHI.  These
proceedings provide a history of the growth and evolution of HCI.  As HCI
has evolved, so have these proceedings evolved  As an experiment in
electronic publishing, the CHI 96 Proceedings are available over the world
wide web.  We are grateful to the CHI 96 committee for taking this step and
look forward to using what they learn this year in evolving proceedings in
future years.
<P>
We also welcome you to participate in SIGCHI, a global society of over
5,000 people with a common interest in HCI.  While the CHI conference is
the most visible activity of SIGCHI, we also:

<UL>
<LI>
support conferences in computer-supported cooperative work
(CSCW), multimedia (MM), user interface software and technology (UIST),
user interface software and technology (UIST), design of interactive
systems (DIS), and intelligent user interfaces (IWIUI).
<LI>
distribute the highly-respected quarterly SIGCHI Bulletin to
members and others
<LI>
supported the "birth" and continue to support the evolution of
two new publications - Transactions on Computer-Human Interactions (TOCHI),
a member of the ACM Transactions series, and interactions, ACM's first
magazine devoted to HCI practitioners.
<LI>
provide support to a number of activities proposed by our members
that provide benefit both to SIGCHI and the field of HCI.  The SIGCHI
Development Fund supports many of these activities and Calls for Proposals
are distributed at this conference and appear frequently in the SIGCHI
Bulletin.
</UL>
SIGCHI is a vibrant and growing community and we invite your continued
participation.  This conference is one of the forums that SIGCHI provides
for people to meet, both formally and informally, to exchange views, to
share experiences, and to learn.  These forums are not just attended by
SIGCHI members, they are defined by SIGCHI members.  We invite you to join
and stay involved in this community and to define the forums of the future.
We also invite you to join with other volunteers in providing SIGCHI's
leadership.
<P>
Finally, on behalf of ACM/SIGCHI, we thank and congratulate the conference
committee and all the volunteers who make this conference possible and who
ensure a valuable experience for all of us.  Thanks for a job well done!
<P>
Welcome to CHI 96 and to SIGCHI
