<h2>Abstract</h2>

In this paper we describe an interface to a heterogeneous 
digital library. The interface is designed with the following 
goals in mind: to support user tasks, to smoothly integrate 
the results of many services, to handle services of widely-
varying time scales, to be extensible, and to support sharing 
and reuse. We discuss each of these goals, and then describe 
a working prototype interface.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This paper describes the design of an interface to a 
heterogeneous digital library [5]. Our project is one of six 
digital library initiatives funded by NSF, ARPA, and NASA. 
The goal of the larger project is to "glue together" many 
different digital library sources and services. The goal of our 
interface is to hide the "joints" from the end users so that 
they can focus on their tasks. We discuss our design goals 
and their motivations, and then describe and critique the 
current implementation of our digital library interface.
<p>
Our interface is based on scenarios and published studies of 
library use. The most important lesson is that library use is 
part of a larger task context [1]. Library users have goals that 
they want to achieve, and individual library activities are 
only important as a means of achieving those goals. Another 
lesson is that the problem is often not solved in a single 
session. Studies of library use almost uniformly conclude 
that systems should save result sets automatically for use 
later [3, 4]. Finally, there is much more to digital libraries 
than search. Libraries, and especially digital libraries, are 
made up of many services. They range from search and 
retrieval, to services that help us understand what we have 
found, to mechanisms that help us manage our results, to 
services that help us pass on our newly-acquired conclusions 
to others.
<p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

Our primary goal is to support user tasks. The tasks we have 
in mind are composite entities, which are not instantaneously 
completed. For example, a user might want to buy a color 
printer. The corresponding library task would involve 
searching for information about color printers, retrieving 
promising articles, sifting through those articles, annotating 
relevant passages, compiling new documents such as lists of 
desirable features, and perhaps sharing the results with 
colleagues or the world. 
<p>
A larger task would be a professor preparing a course. Her 
work would involve accessing materials in the digital library, 
and potentially adding new materials such as an annotated 
bibliography or a syllabus, which other professors could 
access. This task might be divided into sub-tasks for the 
various topics covered in the course. A digital library 
interface needs to provide affordances for the various 
components of each task. Each instance of a task should 
persist across time, since the task is unlikely to be completed 
in a single session. Based on our reading of library-use 
studies, we believe that user tasks require a tool that falls 
between a "scrapbook" and a completely-automated, custom 
application.
<p>
Since user tasks involve an increasingly rich variety of 
services, our next goal is to design the interface to integrate 
the results from a broad array of services. In our example of 
the professor teaching a course, relevant services include 
document summarization, bibliography creation, and "sense-
making" (understanding the results of broad searches). We 
use the term "service" to refer to computational objects that 
take digital library objects, such as documents, queries, and 
collections, as input. We are working with a list of about 30 
types of services, ranging from complex information 
visualization services to (conceptually) straightforward 
translation services.
<p>
Library services differ widely in the amount of time they 
require, so another goal is to design the interface to handle 
widely varying time scales. The interface needs to let the 
user know before initiating a service whether it will take 
milliseconds or hours to complete. While a service is 
working, the interface needs to provide feedback on the 
progress of the service, and a means for interrupting the 
service. If the user has moved on to another task, the 
interface should continue to accept results from running 
services and compile them into a meaningful form for when 
the user returns to this task. 
<p>
Our next goal is to make the system extensible. The number 
of available services is constantly growing. Ideally, adding a 
new service to a task needs to be as easy as dropping a 
"service card" onto the interface for a task. The service card 
would describe the parameters needed to invoke the service. 
It would either contain the service (for example as a Java 
applet) or would point to a network object that would 
perform the service. When appropriate, it would also 
include a fee schedule. Service cards would be exchanged 
via electronic mail or retrieved from catalogs of services.
<p>
Finally, the interface needs to support sharing and reuse of 
information processing knowledge. Bonnie Nardi has 
described how "local developers" of spreadsheet macros 
pop up in many different organizations [2]. We expect that 
with a well-designed task-based interface, individuals could 
share expertise in informal and semi-formal ways. An 
individual who spent a lot of time configuring her "color 
printer" research task might want to share that with a 
colleague who is looking to buy a new ethernet card. More 
formally, a digital librarian's job description could include 
the creation of specialized task templates for use by his 
patrons. Task representations also facilitate reuse by an 
individual, and could be used to manage a history of digital 
library activities.
<p>
In the next section we describe how our prototype digital 
library interface attempts to achieve these goals. We 
emphasize the interface issues that the goals raise, and 
ignore other issues due to space considerations.

<h2>Description of current prototype</h2>

To stress the ability to plug new services in and use them 
right away, our Digital Library infrastructure is called the 
"InfoBus," based on an analogy to a hardware bus. For the 
interface to the InfoBus, we have chosen to use direct-
manipulation, with a relatively straightforward mapping 
between library objects and screen representations. The 
basic types of objects in our interface are queries, 
documents, collections, and services. Services are activated 
by dropping queries, documents, or collections onto them. 
Collections support multiple views; we currently have 
implemented a tabular view and a simple graphical view. 
Clicking on documents causes them to become activated; 
they currently respond by instructing a Netscape web 
browser to display their contents.
<p>
Our current prototype provides an interface to the InfoBus 
search services and to services for sense-making, for 
summarizing documents, for doing copy detection and for 
creating bibliographies from collections of document 
descriptions. The figure shows the interface instantiated for 
a demonstration task based on the scenario of a professor 
teaching a course.
<p>
<h4>Status</h4>

The current prototype has emphasized building an interface 
to a diverse set of services. We are working on improving 
the support for task sharing and reuse. At the present time, 
we handle varying time scales as long as they are in the 
same session, but have not yet implemented a mechanism 
that will allow services to continue to run across sessions. 
Extensibility also needs work in the current prototype. Once 
a new service has been implemented, it is easy for a 
programmer to add it to a task template, but that has not yet 
been elevated to something a user can do easily. Finally, our 
prototype runs as an X Window process alongside of a 
browser, but we recognize that ultimately it will need to run 
in something like Java/Netscape in order to be widely 
available.
<p>
Librarians from our project like the task-orientation, but 
caution us that the real world is a messy place. As the 
interface prototype and the digital library testbed become 
more robust, we will be performing user testing. 
<p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>

There is more to a digital library than search, and there 
needs to be more to a digital library interface than a query 
form and a list of results. Libraries, and library users, vary 
widely, so task-based interfaces are required.
