<H2>ABSTRACT </H2>

<P>
The promises of emerging technologies, strong financial pressures,
and infrastructure demands have created a growing need for technology
expertise in local schools, governments and community organizations.
It follows that there has never been a better time for technical
professionals to help. Assistance can be offered in areas of technology
planning, training, system management and support of fundraising
activities. An illustrative example of a community-based technology
foundation will be described.

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

<P>
The need for community volunteers with strong technical skills
has possibly never been greater. Schools, local governments and
community organizations are hearing daily about the potential
of the Internet, new messaging services, video and text collaboration.
Unfortunately, many of these community organizations are facing
difficult financial futures, as there is ever increasing competition
for seemingly dwindling resources. Changing values within communities,
states and the nation are redistributing and often slowing government
sources of support. And finally, these organizations are often
faced with an outdated infrastructure, such as communications
systems, building wiring, and computers. The human resources available
and trained to help with technical projects may be in short supply.
Perhaps most difficult, the pace of technological change is so
fast that multi-year technical projects are often obsolete before
they are complete. 
<P>
Many corporations, both large and small, are actively involved
in community volunteer efforts. Often, this volunteer work is
a blend of corporate social responsibility and good business practice.
For example, the large telecommunication firm AT&amp;T, which
has always been active in community outreach, has recently broadened
its support. &quot;As competition in the local telecommunications
markets heats up, the work AT&amp;T employees do in their communities
becomes more crucial than ever to build closer ties with current
and potential customers. Realizing the need for a greater local
presence, AT&amp;T is re-energizing its community involvement
programs to actively promote and recognize employee volunteerism
and to connect the company's business needs to the needs of the
communities in which it operates.&quot; [1] 
<P>
Examples of school mentoring and training are numerous. Volunteers
from a Bell Laboratories development group helped New Jersey grade
school students learn about various technical careers at a middle
school career day fair. Another group of Bell Laboratories volunteers
has been tutoring, under the guidance of local teachers, math
and science students at another local school [2].
<P>
Community networks are also emerging, providing local news and
announcements, local merchant information and advertising, and
school information. One example is a Web site constructed by AT&amp;T
volunteer Russ Koester with a non-profit community organization
called Friends of Peachtree Park [3]. This urban community site
is a bridge between the local businesses and the community and
shows off entertainment, shopping, sports and a bit of local history.
Another community Web site that draws heavily on local volunteers
is the Boulder Colorado community network [4]. This community
network carries news, current events and information about a whole
range of topics. 
<P>
Volunteer activities and organizations come in all sizes. At the
very large end of the spectrum is the NetDay 96 project in California
[5]. Volunteers from all over the state are being invited to help
network as many schools as possible in March 1996. An organization
of volunteers called the Tech Corps has begun a nationwide program
to help local schools with technology planning, training and other
types of technical support. At the other end of the spectrum are
small groups of volunteers helping their own or neighboring communities.
Below is a short description of the mission and activities of
a small volunteer run group that is helping introduce technology
into a local New Jersey community. 
<H2>FAIR HAVEN TECHNOLOGY FOUNDATION </H2>

<P>
Several months ago, a group of community members in New Jersey
gathered to help promote the use of technology in the local schools
and the community. As a result, the Fair Haven Technology Foundation
was created. A non-profit organization, the foundation was incorporated
in March 1995 and has the following mission: &quot;The Fair Haven
Technology Foundation, recognizes the need for preparing Fair
Haven public school system students for the future through technology.
The Foundation will provide financial support for the purpose
of meeting the technological needs of the students as well as
other residents of the community.&quot; The Foundation has begun
to promote public awareness of the organization through local
news stories, and has developed an informational brochure that
highlights the slogan -- &quot;education plus technology equals
success.&quot; 
<P>
In carrying out the mission, the foundation has the following
objectives:
<UL>
<LI>provide funding for pilot projects,
<LI>teacher training and technical assistance
<LI>computer training for the community
</UL>

<P>
The volunteer members of the foundation are drawn from the community
and have specific talents in fund raising and technology. 
<P>
While the list of projects undertaken by the Foundation continues
to grow, there are many areas where technologically savvy volunteers
can make a difference.
<H3>Technology planning</H3>

<P>
Help with technology planning is in great demand. The pace of
change and convergence of technologies creates a daunting maze
of possibilities. Members of the Foundation, working with educators
and the school architect and engineer, have helped plan a significant
upgrade to the local schools, including a design for a Local Area
Network. The technical consultation included wiring, system configuration
and cost estimates. Similar efforts will be required over the
next few years to support a multi-year modernization and expansion
plan. 
<P>
A dialogue between the Foundation members and teachers has begun
to understand and design optimal classroom furniture layout and
computer configurations. A teacher survey and visits to other
school districts have been helpful. 
<P>
Long term technology planning for schools and local government
information systems is another place where volunteers can help.
Technology plans need to grow reasonably, protect investments
and match the financial and human resources of the community.

<H3>Technical tutoring</H3>

<P>
The technology volunteers are also involved in several training
activities. Foundation members have volunteered to teach an adult
computer education course, and volunteers have been invited to
help assist in lunch hour computer classroom activities. Technology
demonstrations and computer training sessions for teachers are
underway. In addition, the Foundation will assign a Technology
Angel to each of the Pilot projects that will be funded by the
Foundation. This one-to-one support of the teaching professional
can lead to more successful projects and learning for everyone.

<H3>Web management &amp; consultation</H3>

<P>
To publicize the activities of the Foundation and to share ideas
with other organizations or individuals with similar interests,
the Foundation is developing a World Wide Web page. Web page administration,
updating and electronic correspondence will also be supported.
Of course general network management experience is another key
area where volunteered technical assistance can be helpful. 
<H3>Fundraising support</H3>

<P>
As with any foundation, raising funds is a constant challenge.
Support of fund raising activities by donating in-kind technical
consultation is welcome, as is technical planning for large events.
For example, the Foundation has been planning a Technology Fair,
which requires detailed planning to support vendor electrical
and communications requirements.
<H2>SUMMARY</H2>

<P>
No doubt, the need for technical assistance will continue to grow
within our schools and communities. The volunteer activities cited
in this paper are but a few of the ways that technical professional
can help. For more information about the Fair Haven Technology
Foundation or news of similar activities, please contact one of
the authors.
