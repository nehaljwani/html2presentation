<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>
<P>
As technology advances, we are shifting from direct face-to-face
or voice to voice interactions to computer-mediated communication
(CMC). As a result of this shift the nature of communication has
changed; in particular the ability to convey emotion is less straight
forward. Twenty three subjects participated in a simulated, remote-CMC,
group-decision making session. Twelve subjects had emoticons available,
although use of these icons was optional. The remaining eleven
did not have emoticons available. Dependent measures included
user satisfaction, user frustration, conformity, length and focus
of message, satisfaction with CMC system, and recall of communication
events. The results indicated that subjects with emoticons used
them and were more satisfied with the system than those subjects
without emoticons. Thus it appears that users respond to emoticons
and interpret them as intended.

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>
As technology advances, communication is becoming increasingly
indirect with e-mail and groupware replacing face-to-face or voice-to-voice
communication. One type of technology finding its way into group
decision-making settings is a form of computer software which
facilitates computer-mediated-communication (CMC) (1). Although
CMC can be incorporated in to face-to-face meetings, the focus
of the current research is remote communication, which reduces
the costs associated with convening group members for a meeting
(5). These systems may facilitate in time management and information
distribution. In fact, researchers have demonstrated that CMC
enhances productivity in brainstorming tasks (4). Other research
has shown that CMC equalizes group members' participation by allowing
access regardless of social status (2,5). However, CMC systems
are not without their problems. With the loss of more direct interaction
(face-to-face or voice to voice), the communication process is
altered. For example, users may have greater difficulty understanding
computer-mediated &quot;conversation&quot; rather than face-to-face
communications. Such misunderstandings may be due, in part, to
a loss of information (7), including the emotional content of
the message as indicated by facial expressions or voice fluctuations.
Instead, emotional expressions are masked by the computer technology.
The capability to express emotion in remote CMC situations may
enhance decision making conducted via these systems. One method
of transmitting such information is through the use of emoticons.
For example, if a group member is happy with a decision, she might
send a smile icon with her message, [ e.g. :-) ]. However, research
has not examined the use of &quot;emoticons&quot; in remote CMC
systems. The purpose of this research is to examine the effects
of introducing emoticons into remote CMC situations. 
<H2>METHODS </H2>
<P>
Twenty-three subjects participated in a simulated remote CMC session.
The session was simulated in that subjects believed they were
interacting with three other group members, but in actuality the
comments of these other group members were generated by the experimenter.
Twelve of the subjects had six emoticon buttons available for
their use (see Figure 1). Subjects selected these buttons to insert
the desired emoticon into the text of the message. Use of these
emoticon buttons was optional. The remaining 11 subjects did not
have access to emoticon buttons. All subjects completed two different
decision-making tasks: a selection task and a survival task. In
the selection task, subjects were asked to work with the other
group members to select the best candidate of three for an elementary
school teacher position. In the survival task (3), subjects worked
with the group to determine the most useful survival item from
a set of eight items. Task order was counterbalanced across subjects.
For each task the subjects first recorded their selection on an
answer sheet (paper and pencil), then they received a computer
tutorial on the CMC system. Next, they participated in a simulated
remote CMC session in which they discussed the problem with the
group. Subjects in both conditions received same can messages
except in cases in which they asked specific questions which were
then answered on-line. However, those subjects in the icon condition
received messages which included emoticons. Following each task
on the computer, subjects were asked to recall specific communication
events. After completing both tasks, subjects filled out a questionnaire
concerning the system. Dependent measures included user satisfaction,
user frustration, conformity, length and focus of message, satisfaction
with CMC system, and recall of communication events.

<H2>RESULTS</H2>
<P>
Results indicated that when emoticons were available, they were
used by 10 of the 12 subjects. Furthermore, 75% of the 12 subjects
responded favorably when asked whether CMC enhances group-decision
making, compared to 46% of the subjects in the no-emoticon condition,
although this difference is only marginally significant (X 2 (1)
= 2.10, p = .14).
<P>
In order to more closely examine the effects of emoticon availability
on the communication process, the amount of decision conformity,
the number of events recalled, and the length and types of statements
made were analyzed in four separate 2 X 2 (emoticon availability
by task) mixed ANOVAs. The analysis of the presence or absence
of conformity (a decision change to correspond to the group majority)
indicated that neither the availability of emoticons, nor their
interaction with task, affected decision conformity. However,
subjects tended to conform more in the survival task (61% changed)
than the selection task (35% changed; F (1,21) = 4.13, p = .055).
<P>
A second ANOVA conducted on the number of events (0-4) correctly
recalled, similarly indicated that emoticon availability and its
interaction with task had no effect on event memory. However,
there was a tendency for subjects to recall on average more events
in the survival task (2.7) than in the selection task (2.3; F
(1,21) = 3.39, p = .079).
<P>
In addition, emoticons and the emoticon by task interaction had
no effect on the length of subjects' statements which were however,
longer on average in the survival condition (131 words) than in
the selection condition (109 words; F (1,21) = 4.12, p = .055).
Interestingly, the presence of emoticons did affect the proportion
of messages directed at the angry simulated member F (1,21) =
11.57, p = .0027. Subjects who had access to emoticons directed
44% of their messages (to the angry member in comparison to those
without access to emoticons (20%).
<P>
Finally, subjects' opinions of the communication process itself,
indicated that emoticon availability served to heighten complaints
of lack of equality of participation (t (21) = 1.94, p = .066)
and dissatisfaction with the overall communication experience
(t (21) = 2.04, p = .054). These rather negative opinions of the
communication process by emoticon users are interesting when coupled
with the finding that emoticons users tended to more likely to
respond favorably to the CMC system in general.
<H2>DISCUSSION</H2>
<P>
These results indicate that subjects used emoticons when available
and that they were satisfied with the system more so than subjects
who had no access to emoticons. Also, the presence of emoticons
did not affect decision conformity, memory for communication events
or message length, but it did affect the focus of the messages.
In a previous study conducted by the authors when the ratio of
positive to negative emoticons was 9 to 1 subjects talked to the
simulated members in about equal proportions. However, in this
study subjects with access to emoticons spent much of their time
communicating with the group member who consistently displayed
negative emoticons (angry, frustrated, confused), as opposed to
the members who displayed positive emoticons (happy, surprise)
the ratio of positive to negative emoticons was 1 to 1. Perhaps
this explains why emoticon users were frustrated with the communication
process. This focus on negative emoticons is not unlike face-to-face
communication in which negative events have a higher impact compared
to positive events (6). Users appear to attend to emoticons and
interpret them as intended. Thus, an emoticon palette could be
a useful tool for users trying to communicate emotional expressions
via remote.
