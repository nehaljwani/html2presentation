<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>Time delayed teleoperation exacts a
high toll on human cognitive resources. High error rates and poor
performance times are typical consequences of operating a vehicle
under such conditions. This paper describes the usability effects
of simple enhancements to the interface for a teleoperated lunar
vehicle. Experimental results suggest that simple interface elements
such as a predictive display, steering wheel, and vehicle body
representation can dramatically reduce errors and task performance
times during time delayed teleoperation by inexperienced lunar
vehicle operators.</FONT>

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>Carnegie Mellon University is developing
a vehicle that will allow users to navigate the lunar surface
from the earth. The system is intended for walk-up-and-use operation
by inexperienced users. Our role has been to propose a set of
usability enhancements to an existing interface design. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Teleoperation of the lunar vehicle is complicated
by the five second delay resulting from round trip communications
between the vehicle and the Earth. Under such conditions vehicle
users must estimate the future state of the vehicle based on current
display feedback and judgments about the effect of control inputs.
The mental operations required to obtain such an estimate exact
a high toll on the cognitive resources of users [5]. A typical
result of this is a delay in performing tasks -- to cope, users
adopt a move-and-wait strategy characterized by small control
inputs, followed by a wait for display feedback, followed by small
inputs [3]. Control errors are another consequence of time delay;
studies suggest a log-linear relationship between errors and length
of time delay [1].</FONT>

<H2>DESIGN DESCRIPTIONS</H2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>The vehicle interface design described
in this report evolved as a response to complaints voiced by users
of an existing vehicle interface prototype. </FONT>
<H3>Original Interface</H3>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>The existing interface displays video
from a camera mounted on the lunar vehicle and uses a mouse to
control speed and direction. In tests, users found this method
of controlling the vehicle unnatural a problem which may become
severe in the walk-up-and-use scenarios envisioned for this lunar
vehicle. Users also complained of disorientation arising from
a lack of representation of the vehicle body, making it difficult
for users to relate the broad terrain view provided by the display
to the precise vehicle dimensions, attitude and position. Vidov
and Alexander [4] cite a similar effect experienced by pilots
of aircraft such as the F-16 that provide a broad unobstructed
view of the terrain through a bubble canopy.</FONT>
<H3>New Interface</H3>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>On the basis of prior usability tests
and user comments, our group designed a new interface combining
the following features:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>A predictive display superimposing directional
and velocity information on the video display</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>A representation of the vehicle body</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>A steering wheel for direction control and keyboard
for speed control</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The predictive display has two lines tracing the
vehicle&iacute;s projected path and an arrow describing the vehicle's
predicted position and heading in five seconds (see Figure 1).
Indirect velocity information is provided by the length of the
two lines. The information presented on the predictive display
is based a two dimensional calculation of vehicle location and
takes into account the five second time delay. Predictions are
based on a combination of user control actions and vehicle velocity;
a flat lunar terrain is assumed for the computation. The rendered
result of the prediction is projected into three dimensions on
a video display.</FONT>
<H2>THE USABILITY EVALUATION</H2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>In order to test the efficacy of the
new design, we implemented software prototypes of the original
and new vehicle interfaces taking into account the five second
delay. We user tested each prototype on computer simulations of
two types of lunar terrain. The simulation was built using Open
GL and ran on a Silicon Graphics Indigo workstation. Users consisted
of five males and three females ranging in age from 18 to 38;
all subjects were Carnegie Mellon University students.</FONT>
<H3>Procedure</H3>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>Users had 5 minutes of driving practice
with each interface prototype prior to performing two timed tasks.
The timed tasks required subjects to navigate two courses of varying
difficulty using each interface. The first course represented
a relatively flat lunar terrain while the second course required
navigating a winding canyon. Subjects were asked to complete the
courses as rapidly as possible without colliding with terrain
obstacles. Half the subjects first performed tasks with the prototype
of the original interface; the other half began with the new interface.</FONT>
<H2>RESULTS</H2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>On average, users were significantly
faster completing both courses using the new interface. However,
the most dramatic difference was observed in driving errors -
on average, users of the new interface made eight times fewer
errors than those using the original interface.</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>Table

We also observed differences in driving style across the two interfaces.
Users tended to employ a move-and-wait strategy while navigating
with the original interface. Vehicle operation under this condition
was also characterized by overcompensating control actions. In
contrast, the new interface allowed continuous movement of the
vehicle and afforded a much finer degree of control. 
<H2>CONCLUSIONS</H2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>Our results indicate that simple elements
such as a predictive display, steering wheel, and vehicle body
representation can enhance the usability of teleoperated vehicles
when there is a time delay. The enhancements incorporated in the
new design were tested as a package and so it is difficult to
ascribe the observed results to a particular factor. However,
comments by users suggest that the predictive display was responsible
for the most of the effects observed. Future testing will attempt
to confirm this hypothesis. We are also keen to determine time
delay lengths for which the simple elements proposed in this study
remain effective.</FONT>
