<H2><STRONG>ABSTRACT</STRONG></H2>
The Human Factors and Ergonomics Laboratory (HFEL) at the 
NASA Johnson Space Center is in the process of 
developing an automated software interface checking tool to 
assess the degree to which space-related  
critical and high risk software system user interfaces meet 
objective human factors standards across each NASA 
program and project.  A prototype tool has been identified, 
and usability testing is underway.  Testing compares analysis time and similarity of results for the automated tool and for human-computer interface experts.  The results of the evaluation will be included in the poster.

<H2><STRONG>INTRODUCTION</STRONG></H2>
The user interface is a critical part of any computer system 
and merits careful evaluation before it is released.  
Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) is one way 
to carefully ensure quality software throughout a complete 
system.  The Human Factors and Ergonomics Laboratory at the 
NASA Johnson Space Center is in the process of 
developing an automated IV&V  
tool which will assess the degree to which space-related 
critical and high risk software system user 
interfaces meet human factors standards across each NASA 
program and project, such as International Space Station 
(ISS).  The primary goal of this tool is to check objective 
interface characteristics such as button size, labeling and 
location, fonts, point sizes, and the use of colors for confomance to standards.  The human-computer interface (HCI) 
expert is then spared those time-consuming, monotonous 
tasks and can concentrate on more cerebral 
interface issues, such as functionality and interaction styles. 
This IV&V methodology as a whole represents a series of 
activities which strive to improve the quality and the 
reliability of HCIs and to ensure that the delivered interfaces 
satisfy the users' operational needs.
<P>
IV&V efforts are currently in the early stages.  Several existing 
software metric tools have been identified and researched:  
1) the KRI/AG tool, 2) a University of Maryland tool, and 3) CHIMES, a 
tool developed at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.  Table 1 outlines the advantages, disadvantages, and relevance of each tool to this IV&V effort.  
KRI/AG is fairly interactive and fully developed, but it only 
runs on Motif interfaces and verifies highly subjective 
guidelines [2, 3, 4].  The University of Maryland tool 
assesses objective characteristics (e.g., button size and 
labeling, fonts, and colors), but it is still in development 
and is not yet interactive nor automatic [5, 6].  Computer-
Human Interaction Models (CHIMES) is fairly interactive, 
fully developed, and assesses objective interface 
characteristics [1].  CHIMES therefore fits the needs of the 
NASA IV&V process best, and, as NASA-developed 
software, is easily accessible.

<H2><STRONG>IV&V TOOL DESCRIPTION</STRONG></H2>
CHIMES  has the unique quality of being able to switch 
between two modes, depending on whether an alphanumeric 
interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) is being 
checked. In the demand-modeling mode used for 
alphanumeric interfaces, CHIMES estimates the demands 
that the interface will place on an experienced operator's 
multiple cognitive resources.  In the guidelines-based GUI 
mode, CHIMES checks for compliance with human factors 
guidelines and toolkit style requirements.  Furthermore, the 
latest version of CHIMES allows users to customize its rules and to focus on particular interface components (e.g., button sizes) [1].
<P>
The HFEL's usability testing of CHIMES concentrates on 
its guidelines-based GUI mode and will help the NASA 
IV&V team members refine their concept of the future tool 
and its proposed functionality.  If, after usability testing is 
completed, CHIMES is found to be directly applicable to 
our needs, it will become the IV&V software tool; 
otherwise, an in-house tool will be developed based on 
lessons learned from the CHIMES evaluations. 
<H2><STRONG>USABILITY TESTING OF CHIMES</STRONG></H2>
Initial subjective investigations showed that CHIMES was 
faster than an HCI expert at checking objective interface 
characteristics:  number of typefaces per display, type size, 
type style, line thickness, line style, color usage, and 
consistency of each across multiple interfaces.
<P>
Formal usability testing is currently underway.  Five fairly 
mature ISS interface designs from five different space 
station subsystems are being checked.  ISS interfaces were 
selected for their highly complex nature; figure 1 shows excerpts of two of these interfaces. Click on either graphic excerpt to see the entire interface.  CHIMES 
analyzes the conformance of the interfaces' objective HCI 
characteristics listed above to HCI standards and checks 
across interfaces for continuity.  The time required for the 
complete analysis is recorded.  Four in-house HCI experts 
then individually perform the same objective analysis on 
each interface and the continuity check across interfaces, 
following a formal protocol to ensure that the experts and 
CHIMES are checking the same objective characteristics.  
Each expert’s total time is also recorded.  Their mean 
completion time is then compared to the total CHIMES 
time.  The results of each expert’s analysis are also cross-
checked with each CHIMES analysis to see where the 
results match.  Preliminary findings show that CHIMES 
appears to perform the analyses more quickly and reports guideline conformance and discrepancy in as much detail as the 
experts.  Detailed analysis and results will be included in 
the poster.

<H2><STRONG>DISCUSSION-COMMON GROUND</STRONG></H2>
IV&V of NASA's critical and high risk 
system interfaces is a profound task.  It involves the 
analysis of both mission control and vehicle interfaces from 
the space shuttle and the International Space Station (ISS) 
programs. The ISS program alone consists of ten main display development teams (e.g., 
Systems, Operations, Safety & Mission Assurance), each 
of which is subdivided into at least five smaller teams.  
These teams are all responsible for different systems that are  
developed in parallel; inter-team communication regarding 
standardization of software user interfaces is quite a 
challenge.  This IV&V software tool is being proposed as 
the mechanism for achieving common ground between these 
diverse systems.
<P>
On the shuttle side, the Multifunction Electronic Display 
Subsystem (MEDS) project is redesigning shuttle displays 
and researching the automation of some ground and crew 
tasks.  This project alone could benefit greatly from a 
software tool that could check interfaces for continuity; one 
can see how such a tool could revolutionize interface 
standardization efforts across the entire shuttle program.
<P>
The goal of conformance of space-related critical software 
displays to human factors and HCI standards is an important 
one.  Such a common ground will indeed provide a unifying 
framework for future crews of both the space shuttle and 
ISS.  Standardizing interfaces will allow the crews to 
perform necessary tasks without having to shift mental 
paradigms between systems.  Updates to the software 
tool will also ensure that new HCI concepts and 
technologies will always have an opportunity to be 
incorporated.
