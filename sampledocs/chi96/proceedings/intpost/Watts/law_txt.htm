<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>
<P>
Twenty members of the general public worked remotely from one another in pairs. 
One member of the pair carried out some simple manipulative tasks as instructed 
by the other, after which they discussed the merit of the object assembled. 
Sometimes there was a view of the face and sometimes a view of the room. The 
work was always visible. Contrary to suggestions in the literature that a view 
of the face has only marginal benefits, subjective ratings and direct measures 
of gaze behaviour both demonstrate that the view of the manipulators face was 
of value in this situation.

<H2>DIFFERENT VIEWS FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES</H2>
<P>
The integration of video technology with desktop computers 
and digital networks has presented new opportunities for 
supporting interpersonal communication with pictures. Most 
commonly the picture offered is an image of the face of 
the person one is communicating with. The assumption is 
that such a view will facilitate non-verbal communication. 
Whittaker  [3]  has argued that the evidence for this 
assumption is weak, particularly when the video image 
is of low quality. He goes on to suggest that researchers 
and designers should consider more seriously two 
alternative views that have been used less frequently. 
These are: (i) a view of shared work objects, so called 
'video as data', and (ii) a view of the work context of 
the other person. A view of the work has the function 
of providing a shared physical context which will be 
important in many tasks. It permits physical pointing 
as well as more efficient use of language through 
anaphor and deixis (e.g., 'that one there'). A view 
of the context of the other person makes it possible 
to see whether they are in a position to talk, e.g., 
are they on the phone or talking to someone else?
<P>
A good example of the use of these alternative views is 
presented by the Xerox MTV system [1] . In this 
experimental system users could switch between four 
views, each provided by a different camera. These included: 
a view of the work, an in-context view of the whole office 
and a view of the face of the other person. Six pairs of 
people used this system to perform a sketching task and 
a design task. The view of the face was used least and 
the view of the work most. The informal observations of 
these authors were that the different views were used for 
different purposes. The in-context view of the office was 
used to determine the remote partner's current orientation, 
the face view for conversation and so on.
<P>
In the experiment described here participants were provided 
with two views continuously on two monitors rather than 
switching between them with a rotary switch, as in the 
MTV experiments. In addition, the distinction between 
the different purposes to which a view could be put was 
operationalised by having two components to the experimental 
tasks. In the first, the collaboration was focused on 
assembling a toy. Here, one would expect a view of the 
work to dominate the participants' attention. In the 
second they were to jointly discuss the merits of the 
toy for young children. This discussion task was expected 
to place a greater emphasis on the view of the other person. 
In this way one can provide some quantitative data about the 
utility of different views for different purposes.

<H2>THE EXPERIMENT</H2>
<P>
Twenty members of the general public were recruited as they 
visited a science exhibition at a city centre location. 
They worked as pairs. Their ages ranged from 10 to 65 and 
they had a wide variety of backgrounds. There were two 
parts to the experimental session. In each part the pair 
assembled and then discussed a different children's toy. 
The same member of the pair, the 'Instructor', was given 
instructions for assembling the toy. The other person, 
the 'Manipulator', was taken to an adjacent room (see Figure 1.) 
They had the components of the toy to be assembled. 
The pair performed the assembly and discussion tasks for 
each toy using a different configuration of video link. 
Half the pairs experienced the two configurations in one 
order and half in the other order. The equipment used is 
depicted in Figure 1. Each configuration consisted of a 
work view and one of two possible 'personal views'. 
<P>
<DL>The configurations were:
<DT>1. Face
<DD>Instructor: Video image of the Manipulator's hands and 
the toy, video image of the Manipulator's head and shoulders.
<P>Manipulator: Direct view of own hands and the toy, video 
image of the Instructor's head and shoulders. 
<DT>2. In-context
<DD>Instructor: Video image of the Manipulator's hands and 
the toy, video image of the Manipulator's back  together 
with their immediate surroundings, including the monitors.
<P>Manipulator: Direct view of their own hands and the toy, 
video image of Instructor together with their immediate 
surroundings as above.
</DL>
Audio communication was by way of lightweight headphones 
and pin microphones. The positions of the five camcorders 
and three monitors used is depicted in Figure 1. During 
the experiment, video tapes were made by tapping the 
signals from the cameras used to provide the face-to-face 
video link. The two face-to-face images were mixed onto a 
single video tape together with the work view and a 
superimposed centisecond clock image.

<P>
<H2>RESULTS</H2>
<H3>Questionnaire Data</H3>
<P>
At the end of the session participants were asked to choose 
between, 'close-up' (face), 'room'(in-context), or 
'both the same', on the basis of 5 criteria. The results 
are given in Table 1. In all cases there were 
significantly more 'close-up' responses than 'room' 
responses (p <.05, 2-tailed binomial tests). The order 
in which they experienced the two configurations did 
not significantly affect the proportion of people 
choosing 'close-up' except in the case of the last 
question, where more people chose it when it was the 
condition experienced first (p = .035, Fisher's exact 
probability test), nor were there any significant 
differences in the responses of Instructors and Manipulators. 
<P>
<H3>Gaze Focus</H3>
<P>
The average session lasted for 15 minutes of which only 
3.36 minutes were spent with the second toy. This was 
probably due in part to this being an easier assembly 
task and in part because this was the second assembly 
and discussion task they had attempted. Because the 
small amount of data available for the second toy and 
to simplify this account, gaze focus is only reported 
for assembly and discussion of the first toy. The 
video records were scored by raters, who did not know 
which video configuration was being used, using the 
Action Recorder tool  [2] . The proportion of time 
each participant spent looking towards the view of 
the other participant as opposed to the work or 
instructions was computed. The resulting proportions 
were entered into a three-way split-plot analysis of 
variance. The sampling unit is the pair. The within 
pairs independent variables are: task (assembly or 
discussion) and role (instructor or manipulator). 
Order (in-context then face, or face then in-context) 
was the between pairs independent variable. 
<P>
These gaze data are sensitive to task and view but not 
role. Neither the role main effect nor any of its 
interactions with the other variable approached significance. 
The order (F(1,8) = 10.95, p = .011) and task 
(F(1,8) = 19.08, p = .002) main effect and the task 
by role interaction were significant (F(1,8) = 7.96, p = .022). 
This interaction is plotted in Table 2. The proportion of 
time spent looking towards the image of the other person 
was small whatever the view in the assembly task, in the 
discussion task, however, a much larger proportion was 
recorded, but only when the view was of the face rather 
than in-context.

<H2>IMPLICATIONS FOR DESIGN</H2>
<P>
the general public to this kind of communication technology. 
Without exception, they were able to use it effectively to 
complete the tasks set them. Face and in-context views were 
compared as an adjunct to a work view. Previous investigators 
have cast doubt on the utility of a face view. On this basis, 
one might have expected there to be no difference between 
the face view and a plausible control. However, there was 
a strong preference for the face view and the analysis of 
gaze behaviour shows that this view was used extensively 
during the discussion though not for assembly. In general, 
it is clear that the utility of a particular view in video 
communication will depend crucially on the tasks to be 
performed and the other views available at the same time.
