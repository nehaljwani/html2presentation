<H3>The CHI 96 Electronic Proceedings are still under construction. </H3>

The main challenge for providing the CHI 96 Proceedings electronically
on the Web is the number of contributions. Almost 300 documents need to
be submitted by the authors in a proper form. This means additional
work for our contributors who also are required to provide their publications
as camera-ready copies for the printed publications.
<P>
Editing electronic proceedings is still in an experimental phase. On the
one side technology is rapidly changing and so are the potentials of
the electronic media. On the other side, we are also still exploring
what amount of time and work a volunteer driven group of people 
can spend for compiling electronic proceedings.
<P>
Many hours were needed to check the materials we got submitted from the
authors and load them up and integrate into the electronic proceedings'
web pages. Due to some unavoidable changes in the guidelines of how to submit
an electronic document we got not everything in the proper HTML format and
some authors could not make it to submit their publication in time.
Therefore, we still need to work (in cooperation with the authors) 
on some contributions. 
<P>
When browsing through these electronic proceedings you will
see that several contributions are still not linked into this
electronic document. We hope we will be able to include almost all
publications soon into these CHI 96 Electronic Proceedings.
