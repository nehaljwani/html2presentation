<H3>ABSTRACT</H3>


The purpose of the study was to identify the customization  changes
users typically make to their word processor.  Ninety-two percent
of the participants customized their software in some way.  Participants
who used the software most heavily also did the most customization
(p &lt; .05).   Most of the customization was done to facilitate
the participants' work practices. The most common changes involved providing easier
access to custom or often-used functionality.  Button Bars seemed
to provide an easy and effective means for participants to customize
access to the functionality they wanted.   Few participants customized
 the visual appearance of the interface.

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
It is common for commercial software to allow user customization.
 Users are allowed to add ruler bars, change menus, add custom
macros and applications to menus and button bars, and rearrange
elements on the screen.  The theory is that customization makes
users more productive because they can tailor the software to
their work practice.  However, do users really make use of customization
options?  What kinds of customization do users want to do?

<P>
<H4>Do Users Customize?</H4>
<A HREF="#8">Rosson [8]</A> did extensive research on users of a text-editor. 
She found that programmers made extensive use of customization
features (reassigning keys and writing macros) but secretaries
did not.  She also found that the amount of experience with the
editor and text-editors in general was a good predictor of the
amount of customization done.

<P>
<A HREF="#5">Mackay [5]</A> found that users did not take advantage of the customization
features of software as often or successfully as they could, and
she identified some of the triggers and barriers to customization.
 The three most commonly cited reasons for customizing software
were that users: 1) noticed their own repeated patterns and wanted
to customize to match those patterns, 2) wanted to fix or stop
something that was annoying or slow, and 3)  wanted to retrofit
 new versions of software to make them work as they did in the
previous version.  The most often mentioned barriers to customizing
software were lack of time followed by how difficult the software
was to customize.

<P>
<A HREF="#7">Oppermann and Simm [7]</A> studied the use of customization features
in word-processing, spreadsheet, database, and drawing applications.
 About one-half of the users stated that they had tried some of
the customization options.  They made changes to preference settings
(e.g. changed display measurements from inches to cm) and created
styles.  A few users recorded macros and made modifications to
the menus when these options were available.  They indicated that
customization options made their work easier and saved time. 
However, many users said that they simply made changes out of
curiosity or for fun.

<P>
<H4>Successful Customization</H4>
<P>
Customization is a key element of many types of applications.
 <A HREF="#9">Trigg, Moran and Halasz [9]</A> described the importance of customization
in the design of an information structuring application called
NoteCards.  <A HREF="#10">HyperCard  [10]</A> was one of  the first commercial products
designed to make it easy for users to create customized applications.
 <A HREF="#1">Jones [1]</A> found that customization was one of four major recurring
themes among users of different styles of e-mail systems.

<P>
<A HREF="#6">MacLean, Carter, Lövstrand, and Moran [6]</A> were able to establish a successful &quot;tailoring
culture&quot; within an organization.  They first developed a software system that
was easy to customize.  Then, they &quot;seeded&quot;
the novice users'
systems with sample custom tools built by expert peers.  They
also provided ways  to share customization files through e-mail.
 Providing simple tools and a support system of experts for helping
with customization made it possible for the novice users to become
proficient at customizing their software.

<P>
Others have found that customization can be successful when the
proper formal and informal support is in place.  <A HREF="#3">Krogsæter,
Oppermann, and Thomas [3]</A> designed a successful automated system
that analyzed user actions in a spreadsheet application and suggested
ways of customizing the interface to make their work easier. 
<A HREF="#4">Mackay [4]</A> found that users spontaneously shared customization
files within their organization.  <A HREF="#2">Gantt and Nardi [2]</A> found that
informal experts naturally emerged who helped co-workers customize
their systems.

<P>
<H3>METHODS</H3><!--METHODS-->
<P>
The purpose of the current study was to identify the customization
features used in a commercial word-processing application (WordPerfect
6.0a for Windows).  This information will help software developers
make informed  decisions about how successful they have been in
providing customization features, what aspects of the interface
users want to customize, and how to provide an optimal set of
functionalities by default.

<P>
<H4>Participants</H4>
<P>
Potential participants were drawn from the WordPerfect 6.0a for
Windows software registration database.  They were called and
told that we were doing a study of general use of word processors
and asked whether they were willing to participate.  They were
not told that software customization was the focus of the study.

<P>
A total of 101 participants from across the United States completed
the study.  Participants matched the distribution of users in
our fourteen top market segments.  For example, if the government
industry accounted for 19% of our sales we collected 19% of our
data from government sites.

<P>
Although we did not control for user characteristics we noticed
several interesting demographics about our sample population:
<UL>
<LI>Computer experience of the participants ranged from &quot;one
year or less&quot; to &quot;ten years or more&quot; with
57.4% having ten or more years of computer experience
<LI>Experience with word processors went from &quot;one
year or less&quot; to &quot;ten years or more&quot; with
40.6% of the participants having ten or more years experience.
<LI>The age of the participants varied from &quot;under 25 years of age&quot; to &quot;over 65 years
of age&quot; with 50.5% falling between the ages of 40 and 54.
<LI>The gender breakdown of the participants was 55.4% female
and 44.6% male.
</UL>

<P>
The job categories listed by the participants covered a broad
spectrum and included: Administrative Assistant (13.9%), Secretary/Data
Entry (18.8%), Manager (11.9%), Educator/Trainer (10.9%), Programmer/MIS
(9.9%), Engineer (6.9%), Consultant (5%), and Sales/Marketing
(4%).

</CENTER>


<P>
We also collected data about the amount of work participants did
in the software along with their use of styles and macros for
28 days.   A style is a collection of font attributes and other
text formatting properties (such as justification) that can be
reused and applied to several areas of text.  Macros can record
and play back a series of actions to perform repetitive tasks
quickly.

<P>
A questionnaire was used to collect data about user characteristics.
 The questionnaire contained 31 questions in the following categories:
experience levels, organizational characteristics, WordPerfect
usage, documentation and training, interface preferences, personal
characteristics, comfort with computers, system characteristics,
and work characteristics.
<P>
<H4>Procedure</H4>
<P>
Participants performed the study on their own IBM-compatible computers
running WordPerfect 6.0a for Windows.  Participants received a
diskette in the mail and ran a macro on the disk which presented
them with the questionnaire.  After 28 days the software customization
and usage files were copied from their hard disk.

<P>
The disks were mailed back to us for analysis.  There were three
types of files on the disks: 1) questionnaire responses, 2) software
and macro usage files, and 3) customization configuration files.
 We analyzed the responses from the questionnaire and were able
to re-create each participant's
WordPerfect configuration with the obtained customization files.
 Screen shots were generated based upon the configuration files
and compared against the default configuration to assess the amount
of customization performed.

<P>
<H3>FINDINGS</H3>
<P>
A surprising 92% of the participants in this study did some form
of customization of the software. The maximum number of changes
made by a participant was 54.  The mean was 9.1.  Eighty-six percent
made changes to their general preferences settings (e.g., number
of minutes between automatic file backups).  Sixty-three percent
made use of custom functionality in macros.  Seventy-seven percent
customized the software interface (primarily through the customizable
Button Bar) to add or change access to their functionality.

<P>
Tests of effects were run to compare the level of customization
to the user characteristics captured in the questionnaire.  There
was no significant correlation between the level of customization
and user characteristics including computer experience, job title,
education, age, gender, or learning method.

<P>
The only significant variable found was the relationship between
the amount of customization and how much the software was used
(p &lt; .05).  The more the software was used, the higher the
level of customization.

<P>
We identified five categories of customization activities from
the data collected: 1) customizing functionality, 2) customizing
access to interface tools, 3) customizing access to functionality,
4) customizing visual appearance, and 5) setting general preferences.
 Findings in each of these categories are described below. 

<P>
<H4>Customizing the Functionality</H4>
<P>
Because macros allow users to automate a series of steps they
are a primary means for creating custom functionality.  Sixty-three
percent of the participants used macros.  These macros included
some that shipped with the  application, macros that participants
 had created for themselves previously, or macros that others
had created and shared with them.  The use of macros suggests
that participants want custom functionality that more directly
supports their work.

<P>
The application contained a &quot;macro recorder&quot; that
allowed participants to capture or record a series of actions
(such as keystrokes and mouse clicks) and play them back at will.
 Sixteen percent of the participants created their own macros
using the macro recorder during the 28 days of the study.  The
mean number of macros created was nine.  One participant recorded
25 macros.

<P>
Styles was another feature that allowed users to create custom
functionality. Styles in WordPerfect provide a way to format similar
types of text, such as headings and lists.   Thirty-three percent
of the participants made use of the styles functionality.

<P>
<H4>Customizing Access to Interface Tools</H4>
<P>
<A HREF="#fg1">Figure 1</A> shows the various interface tools that were available
for display in the product.  When participants started the application
the Button Bar, Power Bar, and Status Bar were displayed by default.
 The Ruler Bar and Reveal Codes were hidden by default.

<P>
<A HREF="#tb2">Table 2</A> lists the permanent changes that participants made to
the display of the interface tools.  Twenty-five percent of the
participants changed their preference settings to always display
the Ruler Bar.  The Ruler Bar provides an easy way to visually
check and make changes to document margins and tab settings.

Sixteen percent of the users removed the Button Bar.  The Button
Bar provided quick and easy access to functionality that was also
available through the pull-down menus. Presumably these individuals
preferred to have more room for the display of their document
than easy access to those functions.
<P>


As shown in <A HREF="#tb3">Table 3</A>, the button bar was positioned at the top
of the application window by default and most users (78%) left
it there.  Over half of those who moved the bar moved it to the
left side of the window.  Only one person positioned the button
bar as a floating palette (separate window that overlaps the application
window).

<H4>Customizing Access to Functionality</H4>
<P>
The Button Bar was the most customizable of the available interface
tools.  It allows users to add buttons for virtually any feature
of the product.  Users can also add buttons for running macros
or launching other applications.  Buttons can be  removed, spaces
can be added to form groups of buttons, and the order of buttons
can be changed.  Seventy-seven percent of the users did something
to customize their Button Bar.  The Button Bar is an ideal customization
tool because it is easy to customize and makes the desired functionality
visible and accessible.

<P>
<A HREF="#tb4">Table 4</A> shows the types of customizations made to the button bar.
 The high number of users who customized the Button Bar show that
users want easy access to functions that are important to them.
 The fact that 44% of the users removed buttons that were on the
bar by default suggests that better defaults could have been chosen
by the designers.

The application allowed customization of the pull-down menus,

few participants made changes to the menus suggests that they
are more concerned about surfacing desired functionality than
reorganizing it.

<H4>Customizing Visual Appearance</H4>

Changes made to the appearance of buttons on the Button Bar are
shown in <A HREF="#tb5">Table 5</A>.  Most users (83%) did not change the appearance
of the buttons from the default of text and icon.  Some of those
who changed the buttons to display text only did so in order to
fit more buttons on the screen to provide quick access to more
functions (<A HREF="#fg2">Figure 2</A>).  It is interesting to note that many applications
currently display an icon-only view of the buttons on their button
bars, but only five percent of the participants in this study
set their buttons that way.  This data suggests that people prefer
text only to icon only.

<P>
<H4>General Preferences</H4>

General preferences allowed participants to customize a number
of elements of the software such as where documents are stored
by default, the amount of time between automatic backup of files,
and how graphics and other elements are displayed on the screen.
 Eighty-six percent of the participants made changes to their
general preference settings.  The most interesting changes were
to the &quot;Minutes Between Backups&quot; and the &quot;Zoom Percentage.&quot;

<P>
The program contains a feature that automatically saves backup
copies of the file the participant is working on.  The &quot;Minutes
Between Backups&quot; setting controls how frequently these backups are made.  The default
setting on &quot;Minutes Between Backups&quot; was ten minutes.  Thirty-seven percent of the participants changed
this setting.  Seventy-six percent of those making a change reduced
the amount of time between backups (mode = 5 minutes).  It appears
that because of the importance of documents, participants want
the security of frequent backups in case something goes wrong.
<P>

The &quot;Zoom Percentage&quot;
controls the size of the text on the screen without changing the
size on the printed page.  The default setting was &quot;100%.&quot;
 Fifteen percent of the participants changed the zoom setting.
 Most of these participants set the zoom slightly larger (mean
= 117%).  One of the zoom setting options was &quot;Margin
Width&quot; which set the zoom display to the largest possible setting while still
displaying all the text between the side margins.  Since most
of the changed zoom percentage settings were not rounded numbers
(i.e. 133,119, 107, etc.) it is probable that they were set with
the &quot;Margin Width&quot; option.  It appears that these participants wanted the text to
be as large as possible on the screen without having to scroll
horizontally to see their text.
<P>

<H3>CONCLUSIONS</H3><!--CONCLUSIONS-->
We have shown that 92% of word processing users customize their
software. We think this unexpectedly high number is due primarily
to two things: 1) Work needs. Users who most heavily use their
systems have the highest levels of customization. These users
seem to customize to facilitate their work.  2) Ease of customization.
Customization features that were simple to adapt (like the Button
Bar) tended to have higher incidences of tailoring. 

<P>
In this study we identified five types of software customization:
customizing functionality, access to interface tools, access to
functionality, visual appearance, and general preferences. Here
is an overview of their usage:
<UL>
<LI>The greatest proportion of participants customized the general
preferences of the software, with 86% of the participants making
some change.
<LI>The second greatest proportion of participants made changes
by adding software functionality, with 63% using macros and 16%
recording macros. 
<LI>The third greatest proportion of participants made changes
by giving more direct access to needed functionality. Fifty-five
percent of the participants accomplished this by putting new buttons
on the Button Bar.  Sixteen percent put macros on their Button
Bar. 
<LI>The fourth largest proportion of participants tailored their
system by changing which interface tools were displayed, with
25% of participants displaying the Ruler Bar. 
<LI>The category of customization with the smallest proportion
of participants making changes is visual appearance, with fewer
than 15% of the participants making any type of change.
</UL>

<P>
<A HREF="#5">Mackay [5]</A> states that her &quot;data support the idea that users 'satisfice'
rather than optimize.&quot;  They do the minimum necessary to get by.  We found that participants
who used the software heavily also did a lot of customization.
 So, rather than being &quot;too busy&quot; to bother customizing,
our data suggest that users with high levels of product use adapt
the software to complete tasks more easily.  That only 4% of the
participants in this study modified the menu bar, suggests that
users are making required functionality more visible rather than
reorganizing it.

<P>
<H4>Recommendations </H4>
<UL>
<LI> Expect users to customize the software.  Our pre-existing
belief was that few users customize their software.  The data
from this study suggests that most users want to tailor the software
to fit their needs.

<LI>Make customization easy.  To meet the needs of the many users
who adapt their software, customization features need to be simple,
easy, and fast to use.

<LI>Make customization fit the work.  Since tailoring is driven
by need, customization features need to be designed to maintain
users' work flow and rhythm. This requires that the customization features become
an integral part of the system and its user interface; moving
between task and customization activities needs to be as seamless
as possible.

<LI>Optimize default settings for casual users.  Since infrequent
or casual users do less tailoring of their software default settings
must  be optimized for these users.

<H4>Future Research</H4>
<UL>
<LI>In this study we concentrated on learning what users customize
in their word processor.  We would like to follow up this study
with research aimed at learning more about why users customize
their software and what we can do to facilitate customization.

<LI>The Button Bar proved to be an effective tool for customization.
 Additional studies should be done to compare alternative methods
and tools for customization to identify those that are most effective.

<LI>Finally, studying the patterns of users' customization should
help us move our adaptable systems to self adapting ones; systems
that will accurately anticipate the customers' work and respond
by providing the appropriate tools and services. To this end we
need to continue to study when, why, and how users tailor software
to accomplish their work.
