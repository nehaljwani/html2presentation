Emacspeak speaks each character as it is typed. Pressing the space-bar causes
the previous word to be spoken.  Cursoring through a file speaks each line;
speech is interrupted if the cursor is moved while a line is being spoken.
This allows the user to efficiently browse files.  All of the standard Emacs
navigation commands, <em>e.g.,</em> move to the next paragraph, skip this S-expression, 
  give  appropriate auditory feedback.
<P>
Emacs' knowledge of  the syntax  of what is   being edited is used to
advantage in enabling  sophisticated  navigation.  For instance,
 the user can  move  across <em>statements</em> when browsing
program source code.  When navigating through a file of C code, the user gets
relevant spoken feedback that conveys the structure of the program.  Different
syntactic units are spoken in different voices to increase the band-width of
aural communication.  In addition, the user can have the <em>semantics</em> of
a line of source code spoken upon request.  Thus, when the editing cursor is
on the closing brace that ends a function block, Emacspeak says ``brace that
closes function'' and then speaks the opening line of that function.  This
provides the listener the same kind of feedback that users of traditional
visual interfaces have come to expect.
