We would like to thank the authors of the various Emacs subsystems such as the
WWW browser, email and news readers. Without their work, Emacspeak would
have remained a speech interface to a text editor; in itself not a very useful
artifact.  Special thanks go to Hans Chalupsky, author of the <em>advice</em>
package, without which the implementation of Emacspeak would have been 
difficult, if not impossible.  I would also like to thank Win Treese for
drawing my attention to the power of the <em>advice</em> facility and Dave
Wecker<A NAME=tex2html9 HREF="footnode.html#175">[+]</A> for goading me into writing Emacspeak.
