A screen-reader is a computer application designed to provide spoken feedback
to a visually impaired user. Screen-readers have been
available since the mid-80's.  During the 80's, such applications relied on
the character representation of the contents of the screen to produce the
spoken feedback. The advent of  bitmap displays led to a complete
breakdown of this approach, since the contents of the screen were now light
and dark pixels.  A significant amount of research and development has been
carried out to overcome this problem and provide speech-access to the
Graphical User Interface (GUI).
<P>
The best and perhaps the most complete speech access system to the GUI is
Screenreader/2  (ScreenReader For OS/2) developed by Dr. Jim Thatcher at the
IBM Watson Research Center <A HREF="node18.html#thatcherassets94">[Tha94]</A>.  This package provides
robust spoken access to applications under the OS2 Presentation Manager and
Windows 3.1. Commercial  packages for Microsoft Windows 3.1 provide
varying levels of spoken access to the GUI. The Mercator project
<A HREF="node18.html#icad94mercator">[Myn94]</A><A HREF="node18.html#chi94mercator">[MW94]</A><A HREF="node18.html#assets94mercator">[WKES94]</A><A HREF="node18.html#uist92mercator">[ME92]</A> has
focused on providing spoken access to the X-Windows system.
<P>
 A common feature of  traditional DOS-based screen-readers and 
  speech access packages to the GUI is their attempt to convey the
 contents of the visual display via speech.  In fact, a significant amount of
 the development effort required to design speech-access packages to the GUI
 has concentrated on building up robust <em>off-screen models</em> -a
 data structure that represents the contents of the GUI's visual display.
 Construction of such an off-screen model helps screen-readers 
 regain the ground they lost due to the advent of graphical displays. However,
 the nature of spoken feedback provided does not change.
