Emacs' <b>dired</b> mode, which is used to navigate the file system and perform
operations such as moving, copying and deleting files, is extended to provide
succinct aural feedback.  When navigating through the file listing, the user
hears the name of the current file or directory spoken; different <em>file
  types</em> <em>e.g.,</em> directories, executables and symbolic links are distinguished
by speaking their names in different voices.  Opening a file plays the
auditory icon for opening an object, and then speaks the name of the file just
opened. Marking a file for later processing, deleting a file etc. all produce
auditory icons.
<P>
The auditory icons in this context are very useful because typically,
performing an action such as deleting a file when using <b>dired</b> affects
the current object and moves the focus.  Visually,  the file marked for
deletion is set apart and the focus is moved.  Combining the sound of a file
being deleted with the speaking of the current object introduces the same
level of parallelism in the aural interaction.
<P>
When navigating the <em>dired</em> buffer for the directory containing this
paper, a screen-reader would speak a typical line shown below

examples.tex'',  an utterance that is hard to parse and comprehend.  In
contrast, Emacspeak merely speaks the filename; the listener can repeatedly
press the <i>tab</i> key to hear the various fields of the file listing.
Below, we list the utterances produced by each repeated press of the <i>tab</i> key.

Notice that Emacspeak infers the meaning of each field in the file listing.
Pressing the <i>tab</i> key while a field is being described interrupts
speech immediately and moves to the next field.
