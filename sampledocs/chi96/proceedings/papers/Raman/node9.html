Emacspeak provides a fluent aural
interface to  <b>ispell</b>, a
powerful interactive spell checker.  Here is a brief description of the visual
interface provided by the spell checker for those unfamiliar with this system.
<P>
Typically, a file opened with  Emacs can be spell-checked by invoking  <b>ispell</b>. Errors are  visually highlighted,
with a separate window showing a list of possible corrections.  The user can
type a number to pick a choice from the list of corrections; alternatively, a
replacement can be directly typed in.
<P>
Using this interface with a traditional screen-reader is painful to say the
least<A NAME=tex2html7 HREF="footnode.html#109">[+]</A>.
A user of a screen-reader   needs to query the position of the cursor to find out the erroneous
word, then locate the window of corrections on the screen before continuing.
<P>
With Emacspeak, the fact that the list of possible corrections appears in 
a separate window is completely hidden from the listener.
When running the spell checker, Emacspeak speaks the line containing the
erroneous text with the incorrect word <em>aurally</em> highlighted.
Next, the list of possible corrections is spoken; the user can pick a choice
at any time. Based on the user action, the spell checker inserts the
appropriate correction  and continues to the next error.
<P>
A similar approach is used to provide aural feedback to the common editing
task of interactively replacing a string by another.
Emacspeak speaks the line containing the instance of the
text being replaced, with the instance that will be replaced <em>aurally</em>
highlighted.
This allows the listener to respond correctly when there are multiple
occurrences of the text being replaced within a line.
Thus,  the task of replacing the first occurrence of <b>foo</b>
with <b>bar</b>  while leaving the second instance of <b>foo</b> intact
in the example

</quote>
is trivial; the same task using a screen-reader is much harder.
