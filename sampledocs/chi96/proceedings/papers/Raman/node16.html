We conclude with a summary of what we have learnt from the work on Emacspeak.
Firstly, the design of Emacspeak as a speech interface as opposed to a system
that reads the screen is radically different from what has been attempted in
the past.  The current implementation has achieved a remarkable level of
success in providing fluent speech access to day-to-day computing tasks.
<P>
The convoluted interfaces provided by screen-readers proved  moderately
effective in the case of visually impaired users -there was no other
choice and consequently, users had the motivation to learn and use these
interfaces.  However,  general users  who wish to use speech as an extra
modality to enhance their  interaction with the computer are  unlikely to put up
with such interfaces. The <em>direct</em> access provided by the
speech-enabling approach is likely to produce more acceptable output and make
deploying speech interfaces easier.
<P>
Finally, our implementation of Emacspeak has provided the first true speech
access interface to UNIX workstations.  To date, the only available solution
for visually impaired users has been to access these using PC's running
screen-readers as a talking terminal. Our work provides a viable alternative
to accessing the power of UNIX and the wealth of communication and development
tools that are commonplace in this environment.
