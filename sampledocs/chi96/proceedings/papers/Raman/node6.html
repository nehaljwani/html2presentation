We have motivated the design of Emacspeak with the help of the calendar
example. However, Emacspeak is much more than a simple talking calendar; it
extends all of GNU Emacs to provide full spoken feedback.  The author uses
Emacspeak on his Alpha AXP<A NAME=tex2html4 HREF="footnode.html#71">[+]</A> workstation running Digital
UNIX,    and  on his laptop running Linux.
Emacspeak has been made available on the
Internet<A NAME=tex2html5 HREF="footnode.html#182">[+]</A> and is currently
being used by an increasing number of Digital's customers.
<P>
This paper will not go into implementation details -our purpose is to
highlight the novel interface provided by Emacspeak. For the sake of
completeness, here is a brief sketch of how the system is implemented.
<P>
Emacspeak consists of a core speech module that provides basic speech services
to the rest of the system, <em>e.g.,</em> functions that speak characters, words and lines.
The <em>advice</em> facility of Emacs Lisp is used to integrate the speech
feedback provided by these functions into Emacs.  This facility allows us to
specify program fragments that are to be run either <i>before</i>, <i>after</i>,
or <i>around</i> any function.  Since the user interface level of GNU Emacs is
implemented entirely in Emacs Lisp, the functions making up this interface can
be <em>advised</em> to speak.  The primary advantage of this approach is that
we have been able to speech-enable all of GNU Emacs -a large
system- without modifying a single line of source code from the
original Emacs distribution.
<P>
We conclude this  sketch with an example.
Function <b>next-line</b>  implements movement of the editing cursor to the
next line in GNU Emacs.  Emacspeak provides the following <em>advice</em> to
this function:
<PRE>(defadvice next-line (after emacspeak )
  &quot;Speak the line you moved to.&quot;
  (when (interactive-p)
    (emacspeak-speak-line )))</PRE>
<P>
This advice specifies that if function <b>next-line</b> is called <em>interactively</em> (As the result of the user pressing a key.) then function
<b>emacspeak-speak-line</b> should be called <b>after</b> <b>next-line</b> has
done its work.
<P>
The next section  gives examples of the spoken interaction
provided by Emacspeak when  performing several day-to-day computing
tasks. All of the facilities described are implemented using the model
described above.
