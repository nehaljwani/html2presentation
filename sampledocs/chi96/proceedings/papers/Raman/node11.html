Emacspeak provides a fluent spoken extension to GNUS, the GNU Emacs
news-reader.  The interface permits the user to browse news using the four
arrow keys.
<P>
 We present the user with a simple metaphor of opening and closing
objects. The up and down arrows navigate through objects at the current level;
the right arrow opens the current object, while the left arrow closes it.
<P>
To begin with, the user opens up Usenet news.  The up and down arrows navigate
through the list of newsgroups, providing a succinct verbal description of the
current group and the number of articles that are unread. Opening a group with
the right arrow results in the up and down arrow keys moving through the list
of unread articles; again, the article is succinctly summarized using
utterances of the form ``<i>Sender</i> on <i>topic</i>, 33 lines.''.
Opening an article by pressing right arrow speaks it; the listener can move to
the next article merely by pressing the down arrow, which will interrupt the
reading of the current article, and summarize the next article.  The auditory
icons described earlier are especially useful when browsing news; the aural
cues  for opening, closing and selecting objects allow the listener to quickly
move to the next task in the interface.
<P>
All of the features described in the section on reading email are available
when reading news; Emacspeak presents the dialogue structure present in news
articles using the voice-lock feature described above.
