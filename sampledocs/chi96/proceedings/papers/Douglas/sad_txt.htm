<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
User interfaces for color selection are based upon an 
underlying color model.  There is widespread belief, and 
some evidence, that color models produce significant 
differences in human performance.  We performed a color-
matching experiment using an interface with high levels of 
feedback.  With this interface, we observed no differences in 
speed or accuracy between the RGB and HSV color models, 
but found that increasing feedback improved accuracy of 
matching.  We suggest that feedback may be an important 
factor in usability of a color selection interface.

<h2>KEYWORDS</h2>
Color models, color selection, RGB, HSV, user interfaces.

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
With the proliferation of color displays, color selection has 
become a common task.  Color selection can be done in a 
variety of ways, but the most common method today is a 
direct-manipulation color selection tool.  Both the Apple 
Macintosh and Microsoft Windows provide such tools as 
part of their system software.  Color selection tools are 
typically organized around a color model:  an organization 
of the range of displayable colors into a three-dimensional 
space.  Many such color models have been proposed, each 
oriented towards a specific task.  Table 1 lists several 
models, their intended usage, their axes, and citations to 
more detailed descriptions.<p>

There is widespread belief that some models are more 
&quot;natural&quot; than others.  For example, the standard reference 
work on computer graphics by Foley at al. <a href="#r2">[2]</a> claims that:<p> 

<dl>
<dt><dd>
The RGB, CMY, and YIQ models are hardware-
oriented.  By contrast, Smith's HSV (hue, 
saturation, value) model ... is user-oriented, being 
based on the intuitive appeal of the artist's tint, 
shade, and tone. (p. 590)
</dd></dl><p>

Later, the same text states:<p>

<dl><dt><dd>
There is a widespread belief that the HSV model 
is especially tractable, usually making it the 
model of choice. (p. 597)
</dd></dl><p>

One color model, TekHVC, has even been patented by 
Tektronix Corporation <a href="#r9">[9]</a>.<p>

&quot;Natural&quot; and &quot;intuitive&quot; can be defined many ways.  We 
could compare the effects of color models on user 
performance using any number of criteria. How quickly can 
an expert perform color selection?  How accurately can an 
expert match?  How much practice does it take to arrive at a 
specified level of proficiency, with proficiency defined in 
terms of time and accuracy?  How well does a color model 
help a user select harmonious or functionally useful colors?<p>

There is surprisingly little empirical data comparing color 
models.  Schwarz, Cowan, and Beatty <a href="#r6">[6]</a> performed the 
major experiment to date (referred to in the remainder of this 
paper as &quot;the Schwarz study&quot;).  They compared five models 
and found many significant differences between them.  In 
particular, they found the RGB model to be the fastest yet 
least accurate, while the HSV model was amongst the 
slowest and most accurate.  The slower speed of the HSV 
model suggests it is not so &quot;tractable&quot; as commonly 
believed.  This belief is so strongly rooted that the above 
quote from Foley immediately follows their description of 
the Schwarz results, yet the apparent contradiction is 
unremarked.<p>

The arguments for or against a given color model are 
typically presented abstractly, without consideration of the 
interface which represents that model to the user.  The 
model and the interface cannot be separated, because the 
factors affecting performance of a color model are complex 
and strongly affected by the interface:  perception, screen 
representation, learning, and time vs. accuracy tradeoffs.  
The complexity of the issue and the perplexing nature of 
some of the Schwarz results make the area worth revisiting.  
We begin with a careful analysis of the empirical results to 
date.<p>

<h2>PREVIOUS RESEARCH</h2>
There are only three published empirical studies exploring 
the influence of color models on the speed and accuracy of 
color selection.  Berk, Brownston, and Kaufman <a href="#r1">[1]</a> 
compared a color naming language of 627 distinct names 
versus specifying numerical coordinates in the RGB and 
HSV systems.  They found that the naming system 
produced the most accurate results, with HSV coordinates 
next, and RGB coordinates worst of all.  However, these 
results do not apply in the cases of interest to us, situations 
where the user can select from millions of potential colors 
rather than only 627.<p>

<img src="sad_t1.gif"><p>

Murch <a href="#r5">[5]</a> summarizes a color-matching experiment 
comparing the number of steps subjects took to match 
colors using the RGB, HSL, and Swedish Natural Color 
System models.  A mixture of experienced and 
inexperienced subjects was used.  For inexperienced subjects 
the HSL system is reported to require the fewest steps. 
Unfortunately, no details of this experiment were ever 
published, so we can neither analyze his results nor attempt 
to replicate them.<p>

As mentioned earlier, the Schwarz study is the current 
reference work for empirical data about color models.  In 
this study, five different color models were compared: LAB, 
HSV, Opponent, YIQ, and RGB. Each color model was 
implemented with two input methods. The experimental 
design was five by two factorial, with color model and input 
method as the between-subjects variables.<p>

While the experiment studied two methods of input, these 
were all limited in similar ways.   In each case, the screen 
representation was identical. For each match, a &quot;target&quot; 
color was displayed in a rectangle on the screen and the 
subject used the interface to set the color of a second  
&quot;controlled&quot; rectangle to match the first one as closely as 
possible (Color Plate 1).<p>

<img src="sad_c1.jpg"><br>
<b>Color Plate 1: the screen representation for the Schwarz experiment</b><p>

The interfaces differed in how the 
subject used a puck on a graphics tablet to control the three 
parameters of the color model.  In one interface, called 
&quot;3*1d&quot;, the each parameter was controlled by horizontal 
motion (Figure 1).  Three puck buttons selected which 
parameter was being actively controlled.  In the second 
method, called &quot;2d + 1d&quot;, horizontal motion controlled one 
parameter and vertical motion another.  Pressing a button 
made horizontal motion control the third parameter.<p>

controlled by horizontal puck movement, with three separate
buttons selecting the active parameter.  (Adapted from Fig. 6 of <a href="#r6">[6]</a>).
<p>

A given subject used one color model / interface 
combination to match five colors six times. The authors 
analyzed the time required by the subjects to match, the 
accuracy of the final match, relationship of color model axes 
to accuracy in various perceptual attributes of the target, 
time to reach a given level of accuracy, and learning.  
Accuracy was measured in color distance units (cdus) of the 
LAB color space.  The amount of data reported in their work 
is tremendous;  the following two statistically significant 
results stand out:

<ol>
<li> Subjects matched most quickly with the Opponent  
and RGB models (means of 77 and 78 seconds), 
with HSV twenty-two percent slower (mean of 94 
seconds).
<li> Subjects matched most accurately with LAB, 
followed in decreasing order by HSV, Opponent, 
YIQ, and RGB.  The best color model / interface 
pair, LAB with 2d+1d interface, had a mean 
accuracy of about 5 cdus, while RGB with a 2d+1d 
interface was ninety percent worse with a mean 
accuracy of about 9.5 cdus (these are geometric, 
not arithmetic, means).
</ol>

While the experiment was done with due rigor, there were 
aspects of the experimental task which may have 
confounded the results.  The experiment was done in 1985, 
at a time when interface design was in its infancy, and the 
interface used was rather primitive and not representative of 
contemporary systems. We wondered if the differences in 
performance they attributed to color models hold with 
modern interfaces.  We located the following limitations in 
their interface:

<ol>
<li> No visual feedback of the location of the current color in 
the color space<p>

In neither interface was the subject given any indication of 
the dimensions of each parameter of the space.  
Furthermore, they were given no indication of how close 
they were to the boundaries of each axis.  The controlled 
color simply stopped changing without warning when the 
subject moved the puck outside the range of one of the 
coordinates.  They refer to this process as &quot;clipping&quot;.  We 
conjecture the subjects may have been slower and less 
accurate because they had so little information available to 
orient themselves within the color space.  This inadequate 
representation may even have affected some color models 
more than others, biasing the comparison of models.

<li> No kinesthetic or visual feedback from puck position<p>

The lack of visual representation was compounded by the 
use of relative coordinates for the puck.  This meant there 
was no fixed mapping between the location of the puck on 
its tablet and the value of a given parameter, eliminating 
another means the subjects might have used to orient 
themselves in the space.  For example, the puck location 
gave no indication of how close they were to being clipped.  
The subjects couldn't orient themselves by &quot;feel&quot; (the 
location of their arm) nor visually (by looking at the puck).

<li>No feedback of the effects of each parameter<p>

While the subjects were initially instructed in the effects of 
each parameter, they had no visible representation of what 
the parameters did. It is difficult to infer the effect of a 
parameter from simply moving the puck and observing the 
results, because the kind of change in the controlled color 
varies depending upon what color is currently displayed.  
For example, in the HSV model the saturation parameter 
will vary the amount of red if the controlled color has a red 
hue, but will increase the amount of blue if the controlled 
color is in that hue.  Similar interactions between the 
parameters occur in the other color models.  
</ol>

The Schwarz interfaces are arguably not typical of the direct 
manipulation interfaces popular today.  Ben Shneiderman's 
classic definition of direct manipulation <a href="#r7">[7]</a> includes 
&quot;continuous display of the object of interest&quot; and &quot;rapid, 
incremental, reversible operations whose impact on the 
object of interest is immediately visible.&quot;  In other words, 
the user interface should provide rapid feedback of changes 
to the object of interest. In the case of color models the key 
question is &quot;what is the object of interest?&quot;  While the 
Schwarz interface displays the current color, it does not 
display the color's location within the space of all 
displayable colors.  We believe that the location of the 
current color is as important to the user as the color itself—
the real &quot;object of interest&quot; is not being displayed.  
Designers of current commercial systems have taken this 
into account: the Macintosh and Windows tools mentioned 
earlier both display the location of the current color.<p>

In summary, the Schwarz study contradicts widely-held 
folklore about the superiority of the HSV color model.  A 
question remains:  Will these effects recur in an interface 
with higher feedback?

<h2>METHOD</h2>
We designed an experiment comparing the performance of 
color models in the high-feedback interfaces in use today.  
We were also interested in how screen representation affects 
subjects' performance, and made interface feedback level a 
second controlled experimental factor. <p> 

<h3>Experimental Design</h3>
The experimental design was two-way factorial, with color 
models and interfaces as the two between-subject variables, 
for a total of four subject groups. We used two color 
models, RGB and HSV, and two interfaces with different 
kinds of feedback. Twelve subjects were in each group, 
randomly assigned to a particular color model x interface 
group.  We selected the RGB and HSV models because they 
are commonly used in color selection tools, are frequently 
contrasted with one another in the graphics literature, and 
were two of the most extreme cases of the five used in the 
Schwarz study.<p>

We were interested in how feedback in the interface affects 
the usage of color models; our experiment used two 
interfaces which had increasing levels of visual feedback.  
To address our first two concerns about representation of the 
color space, both of our interfaces displayed the location of 
the current color within the color model.  Each of the three 
parameters of the model was represented by a slider, and an 
arrow indicated the current  value of the associated parameter 
within its total range (see Color Plates 2 and 3).  The user 
controlled the current color either by dragging the arrow 
along the slider with the mouse or by clicking directly on 
some row of the slider.  Both of these methods were 
explicitly demonstrated to the user during the instructional 
phase.<p>

<img src="sad_c2.jpg"><br>
<b>Color Plate 2: the &quot;position-only&quot; interface</b><p>
<img src="sad_c3.jpg"><br>
<b>Color Plate 3: the &quot;position+effect&quot; interface</b><p>

We wanted to see if the interface, and in particular the visual 
representation of the effects of each parameter, measurably 
affected users' performance with a color model.  To compare 
the influence of such a representation, we used two different 
formats of sliders.  One format, called "position-only" 
(Color Plate 2), gave no indication of what each parameter 
did:  the interior of the sliders was a constant gray at all 
times.  The second format, called "position+effect" (Color 
Plate 3), filled each slider with a range of colors.  Each 
pixel row on the slider displayed the color that the 
controlled rectangle would take if the arrow were moved to 
that row.  A user could look at the slider and know what 
effect it would have if it were moved to any point.<p>

<h3>Subjects</h3>
We believed that the differences between color models would 
be most apparent while users were learning them, so only 
subjects with little to no prior experience with color usage 
and selection were used in the study.  All subjects were 
given a screening questionnaire about their experience 
working with colors in both traditional artistic media and 
computer programs..  The selected subjects were forty-eight 
unpaid undergraduates.  Most were from the first year of the 
computer science program, while others were enrolled in 
computer literacy courses.  Subjects were also screened with 
an Ishihara color plates test to ensure that they had normal 
color vision.<p>

<h3>Experimental Environment</h3>
The experiments were conducted in a room with controlled 
lighting  Due to memory limitations in the graphics card, 
the display was functioning at a lower than normal 
resolution, so subjects sat eight feet away from the screen 
so that individual pixels would be indistinguishable.  The 
components of the interface were sized for comfortable 
viewing at that distance.<p>

The experiment was run on an Apple Macintosh IIfx with 
an Apple 8.24GC accelerated graphics card capable of 
representing 16 million colors.  A SuperMac PressView 21 
display was used, set to a whitepoint of D65.  This monitor 
is designed to be used in color-critical applications, has 
stable color rendition characteristics, and can be set for 
various calibrated white point and gamma values.  We 
recalibrated the monitor using the SuperMatch calibration 
tool several times during the experiment to maintain the 
chromaticities of our target colors.  All of our target colors 
were represented in the RGB space of the standard EBU 
phosphor chromaticities used in this monitor, and our RGB 
and HSV models used these phosphor chromaticities as the 
basis of their axes.<p>

We selected thirty colors.  Six of these were from the 
original Schwarz experiment.  The remaining twenty-four 
were taken from the MacBeth ColorChecker chart <a href="#r4">[4]</a>, a 
standard reference chart for tests of color rendition.  Twelve 
of these are representative of colors commonly found in 
natural and office environments (flesh tones, sky blue, and 
common office colors), six are the additive and subtractive 
color primaries, and the final six are an achromatic ramp 
from black to white.<p>

Our data collection program logged the current slider 
positions and the value of the controlled color every tenth of 
a second.  In particular, the final reading of each match 
indicated the total time and distance between the controlled 
and target colors.<p>

<h3>Experimental Task</h3> 
We used a color-matching task:  subjects adjusted a 
controlled color until it matched a target color.  Both 
controlled and target colors subtended just less than two 
degrees of visual arc of the subject's field of view, allowing 
us to calculate chromaticities using the 1931 CIE 2 degree 
standard observer functions <a href="#r3">[3]</a>.  Each subject used a single 
color model x interface combination to match the same 
sequence of thirty different colors.  All interaction with the 
program was done using the standard Macintosh mouse to 
move three sliders on the screen.<p>

The experimenter demonstrated how to manipulate the 
sliders using the mouse. To replicate a situation of use 
similar to what most users typically encounter, no abstract 
explanation of the color model was given to subjects.  They 
were not explicitly told what the three parameters of their 
color model were, nor were the parameters named on the 
screen.  In the instructions, subjects were asked to learn 
how the different sliders affected the color during the course 
of the experiment.  We used Schwarz' wording to describe 
how closely the subjects should try to match the target 
color:  &quot;continue to refine the match until you think they 
are the same color or until it becomes extremely difficult to 
get the colors any closer to each other.&quot;<p>

After the instruction period, subjects were given ten 
minutes to practice using the system.  The experimenter 
was present for the first match and then left them alone for 
the remainder of their practice.  The colors used during the 
practice time were different from those used in the actual 
experiment.  After the practice period, the experimenter 
returned and started the sequence of thirty experimental 
colors. Subjects had three minutes to complete a single 
match.  If they did not finish in three minutes, the match 
was ended by the program and the subjects moved on to the 
next color.  Subjects performed this sequence alone and at 
their own pace.  Times for this phase of the experiment 
ranged from twenty minutes to an hour and a half, with 
most subjects taking about forty-five minutes.  A 
concluding questionnaire asked about the subjects'
satisfaction and comfort with the experiment.<p>

<h2>RESULTS</h2>
The average times and accuracies for the four experimental 
conditions are given in Table 2.  With a significance level 
of p<=.05, analysis of variance revealed no significant 
differences in time or accuracy measured in LAB color 
distance units (cdus) between the models.  The feedback 
factor (Table 3) had no significant effect on time, but did 
significantly affect accuracy (F1,44 = 6.76, p = .013).  The 
mean distance from the target was 2.16 cdus (26%) lower 
when the subjects were given feedback about the effects of 
each slider.  Note that since there was no significant 
difference in time between the two feedback conditions, 
subjects were matching more accurately in the same amount 
of time and not simply trading off speed for accuracy.

<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>
The color model is widely presumed to be fundamental to 
the usability of a color selection tool, yet even with two 
different interfaces we could find no significant difference in 
time or accuracy between the RGB and HSV color models.  
In fact, this is the second experiment we have run using this 
protocol.  The earlier experiment had technical difficulties 
which prevented us from being able to use all of its data, 
but the twenty-four data points which are usable also show 
no significant difference between RGB and HSV.  Finally, 
in a similar experiment, Wells <a href="#r10">[10]</a> could find no difference 
in time or accuracy between these two color models.  We 
are not aware of any measured differences between color 
models when their interfaces provide strong visual feedback.<p>
<a name="table2">
<img src="sad_t2.gif"><p>
<img src="sad_t3.gif"><p>

The high variance of this population may have masked 
some effects of color model and feedback.  With twenty-four 
subjects in each color model or feedback condition, we have 
a 95% chance, i.e., beta = .05, of detecting differences of 25 
seconds or more between the mean times of the two color 
models.  To accurately detect differences of, say, 10 seconds, 
would have required over 100 subjects in each condition---
far more than was practically possible  Considering accuracy 
of final match, our experiment could detect differences of 3 
cdus or more between the mean accuracies of the two color 
models.  While our sample size may not be large enough to 
detect moderate differences in time and accuracy between the 
models, we feel it is sufficient to detect the kind of major 
differences which folklore ascribes to color model.<p>

Comparing the conclusions of the Schwarz study and our 
own suggests which factors determine the influence of color 
model on a color matching task.  We consider three factors: 
practice effects, levels of visual feedback of the interfaces, 
and user selection strategies.

<h3>Practice Effects</h3>
It takes time to learn a color model.  Perhaps differences 
between color model would emerge after the subjects had 
more practice.  Although in both Schwarz and our present 
study subjects completed thirty trials, the Schwarz study 
used the same five colors repeated six times.  Our study 
used thirty different colors to more nearly represent the wide 
variety that users typically select.  We observed that in all 
our conditions subjects had high variance, suggesting that 
they were still in early stages of learning.  Reducing 
variance with more practice would perhaps create significant 
differences in our experiment.  For example, RGB with 
high feedback, which has a mean nearly ten seconds less 
than the other conditions, might be significantly faster (see 
<a href="#table2">Table 2</a>).

<h3>Visual Feedback</h3>
Our study had significant visual feedback, whereas the 
Schwarz study had little.  This suggests that the Schwarz 
results may apply only to very low-feedback interfaces.  Our 
data show that feedback does affect performance in a color-
matching task, improving accuracy of the match.  The data 
suggest that it makes very little difference which color 
model is presented to the user for color selection, provided 
the location of the current color within the color space is 
represented .  Users may adapt to whichever model they are 
given and the model doesn't make a difference.

<h3>Selection Strategy</h3>
If they are not using the conceptual map provided by the 
color model, how did our users orient themselves in the 
color space?  They may have adopted a simpler strategy 
which was independent of the color model.  For example, 
they might have used the following hill-climbing strategy: 
&quot;Move in a direction.  If you are closer to your target, 
continue moving.  If you are further away from the target, 
backtrack and pick another direction.&quot;<p>

To discover user strategies we must look at the paths 
individual users took through the color space from the 
initial gray towards the target color.  A color model is 
supposed to help a user predict which adjustments to the 
sliders will take the controlled color closer to the target.  
We sought a measure of how directed a subject's activity 
was. We define a move to be a single adjustment to a slider, 
from the time the mouse button was pressed inside the 
slider to the time the button was released.  We characterize a 
move by its final color, the value of the controlled color at 
the time the button was released.<p>

If a user has learned a color model and is actively using it to 
plan a path towards the target color, most of the moves will 
end with the controlled color closer to the target.  We used 
the notion of moves to quantify how much backtracking the 
subjects did.  If most of the subjects' moves took them 
closer to the target, it provides evidence that they are 
actively using the color model.<p>

We broke every trial down into its constituent moves and 
computed the distance of the ending color from the target. 
Table 4 lists the percentage of total moves which ended 
with the subject closer to the target.<p>

<img src="sad_t4.gif"><p>

The subjects only moved closer to their target on a little 
more than half of their moves.  This admittedly crude 
measure suggests that the subjects were not using the color 
model to predict where their moves were going but instead 
adopted some sort of simple hill-climbing strategy.  This 
hypothesis is also supported by the significant 
improvement in accuracy for the &quot;position+effect&quot; interface, 
which allows the subject to predict the effect of the next 
move by looking at the screen display rather than reasoning 
based upon the color model.  The subjects were more 
accurate when they could better predict their next move.<p> 

<h3>Color Selection in Actual Practice</h3>
How applicable are our results to actual conditions of color 
selection?  In the field, users typically perform a color 
selection task, picking a &quot;suitable&quot; or &quot;harmonious&quot; color 
for an image, rather than the color matching task of our 
experiment.  We chose a color matching task for two 
reasons.  First, it is a procedure with a long history in color 
science, allowing us to use a well-established experimental 
protocol.  Second, the task gives us well-defined objective 
measures of performance, consistently applied for all 
subjects.  By contrast, an experimental task of selecting 
&quot;suitable&quot; colors would introduce many uncontrolled 
variables, confounding our factors of color model and 
feedback.<p>

Our research explores the precise effects of these two factors 
and their interactions.  While color selection is different 
from color matching, the tasks both involve navigation 
through a color space, and we believe that the role of color 
model and feedback in navigation are comparable in both 
tasks.  Once controlled experiments have clarified the 
relationships between color model and feedback, more 
qualitative field studies can be used to examine their effects 
in actual contexts of use.<p>

<h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2>
This experiment explored the relationship between the color 
model and the interface which presented it to the user.  We 
considered the effect of differing levels of feedback in the 
user interface. We performed a color-matching experiment 
with two interfaces with differing feedback levels:  one 
interface that visually represented the user's current location 
and a second which supplemented that location information 
with an indication of the function of each color model 
parameter.  With these interfaces we could not find a 
significant difference between the accuracy and speed of the 
RGB and HSV models, but found that higher levels of 
feedback resulted in more accurate matches.  We recommend 
that designers of color selection interfaces pay careful 
attention to the amount and kind of feedback they provide---
it may be as important as the color model.<p>

<h3>Future Work</h3>
We would like to extend the work by looking in greater 
detail at the paths taken by the various users and determine 
whether they were using the color model or not.  The 
approach of counting the proportion of moves closer to the 
target can be refined.  We would like to see if the details of 
the traces are follow a pattern of systematic use of the axes 
of the color models or instead have the quasi-random 
character of a hill-climbing approach. As a further 
extension, we would like to run a longitudinal experiment 
to reduce the variance over a longer period of time and see 
what learning effects occur as the subjects become more 
practiced.
