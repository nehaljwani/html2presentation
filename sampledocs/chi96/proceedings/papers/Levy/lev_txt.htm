<a name="RTFToC1">ABSTRACT</a></h1>
Rapid growth in 3-D rendering technologies has deluged us with glitzy graphical
representations. In what contexts do people find 3-D graphs of 2-D data both
attractive and useful?<p>
We examine students' preferences for graphical display formats under several
use scenarios. Line graphs were preferred more for conveying trends than
details, and more for promoting memorability than for immediate use; bar graphs
showed the opposite pattern. 3-D graphs were preferred more for depicting
details than trends, more for memorability than immediate use, and more for
showing others than oneself.  The reverse held for 2-D graphs.

<a name="RTFToC3">INTRODUCTION</a></h1>
Graphical displays of quantitative information are becoming increasingly common
in advertising and news reporting, as well as in the more traditional areas of
business and science. As graphics technologies have become more sophisticated,
graphical displays have grown more varied and more baroque.  Until recently,
3-dimensional (3-D) displays were used primarily to render 3-D data sets in
such specialized domains as CAD/CAM and geometric modeling. The ability to add
depth cues to graphs of 2-dimensional (2-D) data is now commonplace in
general-purpose analysis and visualization packages, and the demand for "sexy"
but possibly gratuitous 3-D graphics is increasing.<p>
Do glitzy graphics do more than attract the eye? How can quantitative
information best be rendered on 2-D surfaces such as paper or computer screens
to facilitate easy and accurate comprehension and memory? In this paper we
report the results of three studies of people's preferences for graphical
displays in which 2-dimensional data sets are rendered as dots, lines, or bars
with or without 3-D depth cues. In these studies we focus on the cases in which
2-dimensional data had to be displayed, and a choice had to be made about the
general type of display to use, as well as the preferred dimensionality of the
graphical elements.  Given the ease with which any of tens or hundreds of
different graph types can be generated using even the most basic of available
graphics packages, the question is one with which journalists, scientists,
designers, and statisticians are confronted daily.  <p>
To be understood, graphics must first be accurately perceived.  Cleveland and
colleagues [3-5] have characterized the ability of the human perceptual system
to extract information from graphs when presented in various geometric forms,
such as angles, lengths, areas, and volumes.  This low-level analysis has
yielded "hierarchies" in which basic elements are ranked in terms of
comprehension scores.  For graphs of a dimensionality equal that of the data,
accurately perceiving and understanding all of the properties of the display is
critical to extracting the information.  However, for 3-D displays in which the
depth does not represent any additional quantitative information, the viewer
must deal with redundant and extraneous cues. <p>
One obvious place to turn for advice on selecting graphs is the graphic design
community.  The message from designers is straightforward: simple and clear is
better, extra ink is bad, and extraneous information detracts from the impact
of the graphic [11].  In one example, Tufte starts with a complex figure with
extra 3-D shading and, in accordance with the goal of maximizing the ratio of
data to ink in a graphic, strips out the elements generating the illusion of
depth. The argument is that if the information being displayed is inherently
2-dimensional, the graphic should be 2-dimensional as well.  According to
Tufte, rendering uninformative depth is a bad idea in principle because it can
lead to misperception of the information of interest, and it can hide the real
content from the viewer.<p>
These admonitions are largely based on the cumulative experience of talented
professionals, and for the most part make sense.  For empirical support we can
turn to the literatures on visual perception and visual illusions.  Early in
this century, Gestalt psychologists repeatedly demonstrated that interactions
among elements in a visual display can result in a perception very different
from the simple physical description of the components of the display. In
addition, there are countless examples of displays in which the perception of a
given stimulus varies significantly, depending on its relationship to other,
contextual elements in the visual field [6]).  For example, Jordan &amp;
Schiano [7] found that the perceived length of a single test line can be
greatly affected by the presence of one additional context line in the visual
display; moreover, the size and direction of the resulting distortion depended
systematically upon the relative proximity and size of the context line to the
test line.  In his how-to book on graphical design, Kosslyn points out that the
ultimate goal of the designer is to have control over the perceived properties
of a graph -- not merely the physical properties of the page or screen
rendering [8].  Given the sort of data described above, it could easily follow
that rendering false depth cues in graphical displays of quantitative
information amounts to placing extraneous information on the page at the risk
of introducing perceptual distortions.<p>
However, in the context of 3-D displays, the conclusions are not necessarily
clear. Such displays may be difficult to perceive when there is ambiguity in
the 2-D representation of a 3-D object, as in reversible figures such as the
Necker cube or Escher drawings. What remains to be seen is whether 3-D objects
are detrimental to accuracy and speed of judgments from graphics. Also, what
parameters of 3-D rendering can be manipulated to minimize its harm? Finally,
are there any benefits to depth cues, and what parameters maximize them?<p>
The little research that does bear directly on the comparison of 2-D vs. 3-D
displays of 2-dimensional data has focused primarily on the extent to which
information is accurately perceived in graphs of different dimensionality.
Results from both perceptual match and magnitude estimation studies have been
interpreted as evidence that added dimensionality has little or no effect on
accuracy [2, 10].  However, there are several alternative interpretations of
these findings, some of which will be taken up in the Discussion.<p>
Taken all together, the message would seem to be telling us to "keep it simple,
stupid." However, this is not the way the world is. For one thing, the world we
perceive is rich, complex, and even ambiguous. For another, a glance at the
morning paper should convince anyone that the graphics arms race is on. The
ratio of data to ink in many publications is going down fast. Information
providers are increasingly producing graphics with colors, pictures, and all
sorts of extraneous 3-D structure. Graph users as well as graph producers seem
to have preferences and opinions about the effectiveness and appropriateness of
these graphs.<p>
Existing research on graphical displays suggests that the effectiveness of
graphical formats varies with context and intended use, but little if any
research exists that demonstrates the extent to which people have sound
<i>intuitions</i> about which graph types are best.  One exception is Carswell
et al.'s study [2] in which students made judgments about imaginary
universities.  They were provided information about two different universities
in the form of several graphic displays.  The impressions that the students
formed about each university were directly influenced by whether the
information had been presented in 2-D or 3-D graphs.  In three studies, we
examine people's preferences for different types of graphics, depending on the
use to which the graphic is to be put.

<br>
<a name="RTFToC4">EXPERIMENT
1
</a></h1>
This first study was designed to be a broad exploration of subjects'
preferences for different graph types.  Subjects were presented with 6
scenarios, and asked to choose a graph type from an array of 9 graphs.  The
scenarios and graph types were chosen to capture the varied situations in which
graphs are used and the range of options commonly available [see Figure 1 for
sample graphs used in questionnaire].
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">METHODS</a></h2>
<b>Subjects</b><p>
<b></b>The subjects were 161 Stanford University undergraduates enrolled in an
introductory Psychology course. <p>
<b>Questionnaire</b><p>
<b></b>Subjects were given a booklet with several questionnaires, including the
one described below, which they were instructed to take home and complete over
the course of two days.  Estimated time to complete the entire packet was
roughly 1-2 hours, with the page for this study taking no more than a few
minutes.<p>
A one-page questionnaire was used to probe subjects' attitudes about a set of
graph formats: the top half of the questionnaire contained 9 panels of graphs
illustrated below.  The graph panels were arranged to form a 3 x 3 matrix, with
each graph labeled with a letter from A to I.  The bottom half of the page
presented subjects with 6 scenarios to consider. <p>
<i>Data sets</i><p>
<i></i>The hypothetical data set displayed in each of the graphs was comprised
of nine data points.  The data set contained 6 trend reversals, where a trend
reversal is defined as the change in slope of the graph (positive to negative
or vice versa).<p>
<i>Graphs</i><p>
<i></i>Nine types of graphs were created in the software program Excel [1]:
(1) a scatterplot,  (2) a simple bar graph,  (3) a 3-dimensional volume bar
graph, displayed from the perspective of a viewer looking up from below the
x-axis plane,  (4) a 3-dimensional volume bar graph,  displayed from the
perspective of a viewer looking down from above the x-axis plane,  (5) an area
line graph,  (6) a simple line graph,  (7) a 3-dimensional volume line graph,
displayed from the perspective of a viewer looking down from above the x-axis
plane,  (8) a 3-dimensional surface line graph, with the same perspective as
the 3-dimensional volume line graph, and  (9) a 3-dimensional volume pie graph.
[see Figure 1]<p>
<center><IMG SRC="lev_fg1.gif"><p></center>
The collection of graphs offered subjects very different options, with choices
between certain pairs of graphs reflecting subtle variations along one
dimension.  For example, graphs 3 and 4 only varied in the perspective shown to
the viewer -- both were 3-dimensional volume bar graphs.  Along the same lines,
graphs 7 and 8 differ in that the former renders a volume by filling in the
area underneath the curve, while the latter representation depicts a floating
surface, even though both can rightly be called "3-dimensional graphs." <p>
<i>Scenarios</i><p>
<i></i>Subjects were asked to "imagine yourself as a research scientist working
at a high-tech firm.  You have been given the chance to present the findings
from you work to the Board of Directors of the company.  Your research
assistant has been assigned the job of preparing the slides that you will need.
Given each of the scenarios listed below, decide which graphs (give your first
and second choice) you think would be the best given the circumstances."  The 6
scenarios were: [note - <i>italicized labels did not appear on the actual
questionnaires</i>]<p>
1)	[<i>patterns</i>]  In preparation for your talk, you are trying to get a
better feel for your data, and want to see a graph that will help you visualize
the patterns and important aspects of your findings.<p>
2)	[<i>gist</i>]  You have only a few minutes to get your points across to the
board.  In fact, you really don't want the board members to worry too much
about details, but rather to focus on the "gist" of what you are saying.<p>
3)	[<i>details</i>]  You've just been warned that the board is going to ask you
very detailed questions about your work, and that you might have to get down to
the "knitty gritty" [sic] of what your work shows.<p>
4)	[<i>trends</i>]  From past experience, you know that your main objective
should be to present information to the board in such a way that they can pick
out the trends and extrapolate from your findings.<p>
5)	[<i>contrast</i>]  You want to convey the fact that the most exciting part
of your work is reflected in certain data points (such as the minimum and
maximum values).  You will be contrasting different data points to get this
across.<p>
6)	[<i>memory</i>]  You know that just after your presentation, your colleague
will be presenting contradictory findings.  You want the board to be able to
remember your results, and compare them to what they hear in the next talk.
<h2>
<br>
<a name="RTFToC6">RESULTS</a></h2>
We report only subjects' first choices as their second choices do not
substantially change the picture.<p>
The pattern of preferences for the 9 graph types for each of the 6 scenarios is
given as Table 1.  Our subjects' choices were clearly not due to random
variation ([[chi]]<sup>2</sup> = 304.959, p &lt; .0001).  Due to the
exploratory design of this study, the data do not lend themselves to a rigorous
statistical analysis.  Nevertheless, some conclusions do seem warranted.  The
area bar graph and the simple line graph, two familiar types, were the most
popular overall.  Of the two 3-D volume bar graphs, subjects greatly preferred
the view from above to the view from below (94 to 19).  Of the two 3-D line
graphs, they chose the 3-D volume more often than the 3-D surface (90 to 41).
For Scenario 1, which emphasized understanding the data for one's self,
subjects liked a bar area graph best.  (This type is arguably one of the most
familiar.)  For getting a point across quickly (Scenario 2) or picking out
general trends (Scenario 4), subjects preferred a simple line graph.<p>
<center><IMG SRC="lev_tb1.gif"></center>
<h1>
<br>
<a name="RTFToC7">EXPERIMENT
2
</a></h1>
In this experiment, we sought to refine our initial findings by more carefully
manipulating the graph types, scenarios and data sets employed.  In the
literature, the use of the term "3-D graph" has been applied to many different
types of graphs.  Here we distinguish between graphs that add depth to create
the impression of a surface suspended in space and those that add depth to
create the impression of an object with volume. The instructions for Experiment
1 suggested a very particular situation (the "board room"); here we created
generic scenarios that avoided referencing specific situations and focused on
more general circumstances.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">METHODS</a></h2>
<b>Subjects	</b><p>
<b></b>The subjects were 110 Stanford University undergraduates enrolled in an
introductory Psychology course.<p>
<b>Questionnaire  </b><p>
<b></b>Subjects filled out a 1-page questionnaire, of the same format and
distributed in the same manner as in Experiment 1.<p>
<i>Data sets</i><p>
<i></i>Two versions of the questionnaire were prepared, differing only in the
nature of the data depicted in the graphs themselves.  Each data set consisted
of nine data points.  In one version, the <i>general trend</i> (GT) data set,
the graphs of the data formed a slightly right-skewed curve.  In the second
version, the data points were selected to create a <i>multiple reversal
</i>(MR) data set.  Applying the definition of a trend reversal as the change
in slope of the graph (positive to negative or vice versa), the GT data set
contained 1 trend reversal, while the MR data set involved 6 trend reversals.
Data set (GT or MR) was a between-subject variable.<p>
<i>Graphs</i><p>
<i></i>Nine types of graphs were created.  The graphs are shown in Figure 2,
and included:  (1) a scatterplot,  (2) a simple line graph,  (3) an area line
graph,  (4) a 3-dimensional volume line graph,  (5) a 3-dimensional surface
line graph,  (6) a simple bar graph,  (7) an area bar graph,  (8) a
3-dimensional volume bar graph, and (9) a 3-dimensional surface bar graph, in
which only the tops of 3-dimensional bars were used to indicate quantity on the
y-axis.<p>
<center><IMG SRC="lev_fg2.gif"><p></center>
With the exception of the scatterplot, the graphs were divided into two broad
categories--<i>line graphs</i> that connected the data points(2,3,4,5), and
<i>bar graphs</i> that plotted each data point independently with a vertical
element of some sort (6,7,8,9).  Within each category, an example of a simple
graph, an area graph, a volume graph and a surface graph was created.  While
the simple graphs (2 &amp; 6) and area graphs (3 &amp; 7) are familiar formats
that do not need much explanation, the distinctions between the 3-dimensional
graph types are important and not as readily apparent.<p>
All graphs were created using standard graphing commands in Microsoft Excel
[1], except for graphs 6 &amp; 9, which were rendered in a drawing program.  <p>
<i>Scenarios</i><p>
<i></i>The 6 scenarios listed below were designed to set up contrasts on three
dimensions: <i>self</i> vs. <i>other</i> (scenarios 1 &amp; 2), <i>details</i>
vs. <i>trends</i> (scenarios 3 &amp; 4), and <i>now</i> vs. <i>later</i>
(scenarios 5 &amp; 6).<p>
1)	[<i>self</i>]  You've just finished collecting all this information.  You
want to see it graphically displayed so that you can understand what is going
on.  This is just for your own use; you won't be showing the graph to others.<p>
2)	[<i>other</i>]  You need to represent your data graphically for a group of
people.  Conveying what is going on to them is critical.  You want them to
understand your findings as fully as possible.<p>
3)	[<i>details</i>]  You want to make a graph that will show the detailed
relationships in the data.  It is important that the specifics of how each data
point relates to the others be evident in the figure.  The details are
critical.<p>
4)	[<i>trends</i>]  You need to quickly show general trends in the data.  One
should be able to just glance at the figure and understand what is going on.
The important thing here is the "gist."<p>
5)	[<i>now</i>]  You need to present your data to help people make an immediate
decision.  It makes no difference if they remember this next week--the decision
needs to be made correctly today.  The graph should convey the information
right here and now.<p>
6)	[<i>memory</i>]  Your data will be used to make a decision in a few weeks.
Someone looking at your graph will need to be able to remember it's content
later without referring back to it.  You should make the figure as memorable as
possible.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC9">RESULTS</a></h2>
As in Experiment 1, we analyzed only subjects' first choices.  As in the first
study, our subjects' judgments were non-random.  (For the multiple-reversal
data set, [[chi]]<sup>2</sup> = 106.787, p &lt; .0001; for the general trend
data set, [[chi]]<sup>2</sup> = 104.272, p &lt; .0001.)  In general, their
pattern of choices was quite similar for the multiple-reversal and general
trend data sets (r = 0.74).  Some obvious and non-surprising patterns jump out
of the data (see Table 2).   Our subjects clearly chose different graphs for
different situations.  Overall, they liked the familiar area bar and simple
line graphs best (chosen 132 and 129 times out of 654, respectively).  They
rarely chose the simple bar (13 times) or 3-D surface bar graphs (9 times).<p>
The more structured design of this survey also permits a more detailed
analysis.  We can look at preferences for graphs of different dimensionality by
collapsing over data set and collapsing the line and bar graphs.  When we do
so, a consistent pattern emerges.  For all of the 3 pairs of questions,
subjects' preferences for simple, area, 3-D volume, and 3-D surface graphs
changed systematically.  Simple and area graphs were liked for some sets of
circumstances, and 3-D volume and surface graphs for others (see Figure 3a).
Subjects liked simple and area graphs better for their own use than for
presenting to others; the opposite pattern held for 3-D volume and 3-D surface
plots.  They chose the 3-D graph types more often when the data had to be
remembered, and simple and area graph types more often when the figure was for
immediate use.  Finally, they liked the two types of 3-D graphs better for
showing detailed relationships than for showing the "gist", while the opposite
pattern held for the simple and area graphs.<p>
<b><em>
<center><IMG SRC="lev_fg3a.gif"></em></b></center>
<h1>
<center><IMG SRC="lev_fg3b.gif"></h1></center>
If we collapse over data set and collapse over dimensionality, another pattern
emerges.  Our subjects chose line and bar graphs for different uses.  They
chose line graphs more often when the data had to be remembered than when the
graph was for immediate use; the opposite pattern held for bar graphs. Our
subjects liked line graphs better for general trends than for details.  Bar
graphs, on the other hand, were chosen more for details than for trends (see
Figure 3b).<p>
Both of the patterns described above were robust; each holds for both the
multiple reversal data set and the general trend data set results individually,
as well as for the combined data.
<h1>
<a name="RTFToC10">EXPERIMENT
3
</a></h1>
In this final experiment, we focused on the central question of preferences for
"2-D vs 3-D" graphics by creating a two-alternative, forced-choice
questionnaire.  The format and procedures were identical to those described in
Experiments 1 &amp; 2, except for the number of graph  panels presented.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC11">METHODS</a></h2>
<b>Subjects	</b><p>
<b></b>The subjects were 157 Stanford University undergraduates enrolled in an
introductory Psychology course.<p>
<b>Questionnaire  </b><p>
<b></b>Subjects filled out a 1-page questionnaire, similar in format and
distributed in the same manner as in the previous experiments.  Four versions
of the questionnaire were created by crossing type of graph (line vs. bar) and
order of presentation (2-D area graph first vs. 3-D volume graph first).<p>
<i>Data sets</i><p>
<i></i>All versions of the questionnaire depicted the multiple reversal data
set used in Experiment 2.<p>
<i>Graphs</i><p>
<i></i>Each questionnaire displayed only two graphs: an area graph and a volume
graph.  The graphs were either line graphs or bar graphs.<b> </b><p>
<b></b><i>Scenarios</i><p>
<i></i>Subjects were shown the six scenarios used in Experiment 2, and were
given the same instructions--to pick the graph most appropriate for each
situation described. <b></b>
<h2>
<br>
<a name="RTFToC12">RESULTS</a></h2>
A clear pattern of preferences that reinforce the findings from Experiments 1
&amp; 2  emerged (see Figure 4).   Not only can comparisons be made between
preferences within each graph dimensionality (i.e., 2-D graphs were preferred
more often for presenting to one's self than when presenting to others), but
relative preferences for employing 2-D or 3-D graphs can also be assessed.  For
most situations, subjects preferred the 2-D area graph.  Two exceptions are
when graphs were to be used for presenting data to others, in which case there
was no significant difference in preference for the two graph types (p &lt;
0.31), and when the graph needed to be memorable, in which case the 3-D volume
graph was significantly preferred (p &lt; 0.01). <p>
When assessing the pattern of results for each of the three continuum--self vs.
other, detail vs. trend, and now vs. later--significant interactions exist
between the dimensionality of the graph and the proposed use scenario
([[chi]]<sup>2</sup> = 62.59, [[chi]]<sup>2</sup> = 59.07, and
[[chi]]<sup>2</sup> = 71.86 respectively).<b></b>
<h1>
<center><IMG SRC="lev_fg4.gif"><br></center>
<a name="RTFToC13">GENERAL
DISCUSSION
</a></h1>
The key findings of the three surveys can be described as follows.  First,
subjects were not leery of choosing graphs with 3-D shading.  Second, they
found different graph types appropriate for different rhetorical purposes.
They systematically chose line graphs for different circumstances from bar
graphs, and chose 3-D graphs for different situations from 2-D graphs.  In
particular, they chose 3-D graphs over 2-D graphs when the situation demanded
memory, and equally often when it involved communication to others.  In
addition, the use of 3-D graphs was deemed more appropriate for certain
scenarios than other scenarios: for examining details rather than trends in
data, for making a memorable rather than an immediate impression, and when
using a graph to communicate to others over situations in which the graph is
for one's self.  Finally, subjects preferred graphs that strongly suggested a
3-D volume to those that depicted a surface floating in space.<p>
Why this robust pattern of preferences for these 3-D graphs?  Our subjects
consistently selected 3-D graphs for various scenarios, and rejected them for
others.  Moreover, out in the real world scientists and business-people are
voting with their feet (and their trackballs and mice) for 3-D graphs.  This
may be just the tip of the iceberg, considering the general proliferation of
3-D interfaces and computing environments being developed.<p>
We propose two possible explanations for these preferences. The more
parsimonious of the two is a simple discriminability or salience account.  In
Experiments 2 &amp; 3, subjects chose the 3-D volume (and surface) graphs more
often when the scenario demanded memory or showing data to others.  Under these
conditions people may feel that extra graphical flourishes will make the figure
stand out, making the graph both more memorable and more impressive to
others.<p>
A second explanation derives from the ecological and evolutionary situatedness
of our visual systems.  We have evolved to deal with a world of 3-D objects and
3-D scenes.  Figures that more strongly suggest a spatially realistic
environment may better engage our visual systems, and may be more easily coded
in terms of schemas we have for visual scenes.  This kind of facilitation could
be helpful for communicating a pattern to others or keeping it distinct in
memory.  This hypothesis might also explain why people like 3-D volume graphs
more than 3-D surface graphs:  the former more closely resemble solid objects
such as the ones we deal with in the real world.  While this view is not
directly addressed in the work we report here, it serves as an interesting and
plausible explanation.  Our subjects did seem to have had a sense that graphs
with depth were more appropriate for communicating and remembering, and they
found realistic volumes preferable to unlikely floating surfaces.  Could it be
that their intuitions were in line with their actual abilities?<p>
This possibility has some support in the small literature directly comparing
2-D and 3-D graphs of quantitative information.  Two recent studies [2, 10]
failed to find a difference in accuracy of estimates from 2-D and 3-D graphs.
However, one of these studies [2] failed to distinguish between 3-D surface and
3-D volume graphs; the other [10] averaged data over several heterogeneous 3-D
graph types.  In light of the great differences we found in peoples'
preferences for these types of graphs, it seemed worthwhile to attempt a more
direct comparison.  In a recent series of studies in our laboratory [9], we
compared analogous versions of 2-D area and 3-D volume bar graphs.  Under these
conditions, we found a reliable and suggestive effect of dimensionality: adding
depth cues impaired accuracy in both a magnitude estimation and a perceptual
match task. However, this performance difference was small.  Moreover, it
vanished when subjects had to make their judgments from memory (perceptual
match task exercising a very short-term form of working memory).<p>
At this point we can conclude with some certainty that people prefer graphs of
quantitative information enhanced by 3-D shading for some situations.  More
pronounced and important is the fact that these preferences show a systematic
structure.  For our subjects, adding 3-D shading to 2-D displays amounted to
more than simply adding more ink to the page, or pixels on the computer screen.
The challenge for designers and consumers of graphics is to learn about and
take advantage of these preferences for features inherent in graphic displays.
For behavioral scientists, it is to discover the extent to which these
preferences have a basis in the human perceptual system.
