<a name="RTFToC1">ABSTRACT
</a></h2>
HomeNet is a field trial of residential Internet use with lowered barriers to
use. We use multiple longitudinal data collection techniques, including
server-side instrumentation. This paper is an initial description of how
diverse families used the Internet in the first five months of the trial, and
of variables that predicted this usage. The results have implications for
design (e.g., provide more help for adults to get started), for marketing
(e.g., lower income people have as much desire for on-line services as do upper
income people), and for research (e.g., understand why teenagers' lead family
computing).

<a name="RTFToC3">THE
HOMENET PROJECT 
</a></h2>
<br>"I really want to move to Antarctica--I'd want my cat and Internet access
and I'd be happy."<br>--16 year old HomeNet participant, 1995.<p>
In the 1980s, personal computers and networking transformed workplace
communication [11].  As these social changes took place, few researchers and
developers looked at networking in the home.  And when they did look, they did
so narrowly--seeing networking at home as an extension of networking in the
office.  <p>
<p>
In the 1990s, computers are moving into the home at an enormous rate. In
contrast to the 1980s, telecommuting and other workplace applications are not
the only, or even the main, reasons for this change. By 1994, approximately 31%
of US households had a computer [12], and in 1994, computers for the home
represented 40% of PC sales.  The potential for families, businesses, and
community services is enormous.  Yet we still lack an understanding of the
changes taking place.  In particular, we know  very little about which
electronic services are valuable to people across incomes in diverse
communities.  We also know little about how to make electronic services more
valuable--whether through better design, better training, or a different array
of services.<p>
HomeNet is an empirical field trial of residential Internet use whose goal is
to increase our knowledge about the use and impact of residential electronic
services.  It is a true, pretest-posttest field experiment.  It uses a
longitudinal panel design to study families over time.  The project soon begins
its second year.  Our goal in this early report is to describe how average
citizens (as represented in our study) use the Internet and to predict what
leads them to use it. <b></b>
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC4">Diverse
HomeNet Families
</a></h3>
Our current knowledge of electronic services in general and the Internet in
particular is based upon the behavior of the predominately upper income, white
male professionals who buy computers and have used these services in the past
(e.g., [13]).  Moreover, the income and education gap between users and
non-users of on-line services has been increasing during the last ten years
[1].  Our research presumes that as computers become cheaper and on-line
services easier to use, future users of these services may well be unlike
current users.  Therefore we set out to investigate how a broader sample of
people would use and value electronic services.  <p>
To accomplish this goal, the HomeNet project is based on a service model with
low barriers to entry.  We loaned families a computer, or if they preferred,
sold it to them at half price.  Each family also received a high speed modem,
and an extra telephone line as well as full Internet accounts for each family
member above age 8 who wanted one. We simplified Internet access. All computers
included a turnkey system--for access to the entire Internet--to newsgroups,
the World Wide Web, electronic mail, MUDs, and special HomeNet chat newsgroups.
Our software configuration allowed family members to use Internet services
without learning the details of any computer operating system.  Their Internet
services were individualized, for example, by providing each family with a Web
homepage pointing to information sources tailored to their identified
interests.  They received approximately three hours of training.  We also
offered on-line support through a help newsgroup and email, and an evening
telephone help desk staffed by college students.<p>
We recruited an initial sample of 48 families (157 individuals) through the
public high schools of four neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, PA, selected for their
demographic diversity.  In each school, we recruited students who worked on the
school newspaper and their families, as well as at least one journalism teacher
and teacher's family.  The common bond of journalism gave students from
different schools something to discuss as we put the project on-line.  <p>
The result of these procedures is that while the HomeNet sample is not
representative of the US population, it is more demographically diverse than
existing Internet demographics (see Table 1).

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">DATA
COLLECTION
</a></h2>
The HomeNet project uses five sources of data: (1) computer-generated usage
records of email traffic, newsgroups read and posted to, Web sites and MUDs
visited, and time on the Internet; (2) pre-trial, bi-monthly, and post-trial
questionnaires; (3) an archive of HomeNet newsgroup messages; (4) a log of help
requests, and (5) home interviews.  The analyses reported in this paper rely
mainly on the computer-generated usage data, in-depth interviews with 14
families, and the pretest questionnaire. All subjects signed detailed informed
consent forms.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC6">HOW
DO FAMILIES USE THE NET?
</a></h2>
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC7">It
is hard to get started
</a></h3>
Currently, even the easiest-to-use computers and applications pose significant
barriers to peoples' use of on-line services. Potential Internet users vary
widely in their computer skill, and many have little computer experience.
Among the HomeNet participants, 21% reported never having used a computer
before the trial started. In contrast, 17% used a home computer at least daily.
<p>
Getting started was a major problem for many of the families.  Connecting to
the Internet is far more difficult than getting telephone or TV service.  It
requires that people correctly navigate a complex sequence of steps, from
obtaining and setting up a computer, to establishing telephone service, to
learning application software, to defining and remembering a password. Even
with help and our simplified procedure, HomeNet participants had trouble
connecting to the Internet for a wide variety of reasons--bad telephone lines
and busy signals, passwords forgotten, depressed shift-lock keys on keyboards,
erased login scripts, buggy software, and so forth. <p>
Many participants lacked the skills to diagnose problems, in part because they
did not have clear models of how components of the overall system operated.
Their problems were more likely to be solved quickly if other family members or
friends were more sophisticated than they or if they felt comfortable revealing
their ignorance to the strangers on a help desk.  Although teens typically
became the most skilled computer users in their families, they were sometimes
reluctant to share their expertise with their parents.  Some participants
blamed themselves for problems that were due to software bugs or overtaxed
servers. Others asked for help from the project staff--122 times over the first
6 weeks of the trial period.  The frequency of requesting help declined as
people got started (or gave up), and as participants became more skilled in
navigating the Internet.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC8">Internet
Use Is Strong in the Aggregate, But Varies Widely and Declines With Time
</a></h3>
<IMG SRC="rek_fg1.gif" alt="Figure 1"><p>
Figure 1.  Distribution of logging into the Internet.<p>
Of the 157 participants who received Internet accounts, 126 logged into the
Internet (i.e., dialed in to the HomeNet server) from home at least once during
the first 22 weeks of the trial.  Participation differed enormously among them.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of Internet sessions per person.  While the
modal number of logins was less than twice a week, some participants logged in
multiple times per day and had accumulated almost 500 logins during the first
22 weeks of the trial. The first three columns in Table 2 show some descriptive
statistics about participants' 
<IMG SRC="rek_fg2.gif" alt ="Figure 2"><p>
Figure 2. Percent of Participants Logging in Per Week<p>
 <br>Note: Percentages have been normalized to a equal number of participants
in each demographic group.  If everyone in each group used the Internet weekly,
then the graph would show four parallel bands, each representing 25% of the
users.<p>
use of different Internet services. The distribution of each of these measures
is also highly skewed. For example, approximately 12% of those who  logged in
sent no electronic mail messages over the study period, but one user sent over
2500 messages. <p>
Internet use was initially strong, but declined over time. During the first
weeks of the trial approximately three-quarters of the participants logged in
at least weekly (see  Figure 2). Usage declined to about fifty percent by week
22.  A noticeable dip occurred in week 14, when school let out for the summer,
as travel, summer jobs, and outdoor activities cut into time on the computer.
<p>
Usage differed by generation and gender.  For example, at the midpoint of the
trial (week 11), 62% of the teenagers logged into the Internet compared to only
about 45% of the adults. Among the teenagers, males were much heavier users
than females; among adults, males were slightly higher user than females.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC9">Net
Use Is Interrelated
</a></h3>
Most discussion of the Internet distinguishes communication services like
electronic mail, from information services like the World Wide Web. The
boundary, however, is blurry and growing blurrier as  individuals learn to be
their own broadcasters or post information to a newsgroup to response to a
particular message.  <p>
We find that these conceptually distinct services are complementary.  People
who used communication services were also likely to use information services,
and vice versa, and both kinds of use predicted the number of logins to the
Internet and the number of hours spent engaged with it.  Table 2 shows the
descriptive statistics for various measures of Internet use and the
correlations among them.  Because usage was skewed, measures were converted to
the log scale before the correlations were calculated. The average correlation
is high (.70 for all participants shown in Table 1 and .52 for the 88 heaviest
users).  This result indicates that HomeNet participants who used any Internet
service used most of them--electronic mail, newsgroups, and the World Wide Web.
Follow-up time-series analyses will allow us to determine whether communication
or information consumption is causally prior.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC10">Teens
Lead the Family
</a></h3>
Our data also showed that usage within families was interrelated.  In 41 of the
48 families, the heaviest user was one of the children.  There was a
significant correlation (<i>r=</i>.54, <i>n</i>=48, <i>p</i> &lt; .01) between
the usage of the heaviest user in the family and the average use by other
family members.  Heavy use by a child predicted both siblings' (<i>r</i> = .43)
and parental use (<i>r</i> = .42). Because so few adults were heavy users, we
cannot tell if their use also drove that of their spouses or children.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC11">Participants
Discover Communication
</a></h3>
According to their pretrial questionnaires, participants didn't see computers
as particularly useful for interpersonal communication.  They thought computers
were valuable for doing school work, for learning, and for performing household
chores.  Yet like people discovering the telephone at the turn of the century,
chit-chat quickly became the dominant use of the Internet, and especially so
for teenagers.  <p>
Overall, the median teenager sent almost six times as many electronic mail
messages as the median adult.  The generation difference, however, was greater
for males than for females.  Teenage males sent 25 times more messages than
adult males, while teenage girls sent only six times more messages than adult
males. Teenage boys sent almost twice as many messages as teenage girls. Almost
all of the teenagers' messages went to other teens (94%), whereas the adults
communicated approximately equally to teens and other adults.
<img src="rek_fg3.gif" alt="Table 2"><br>
Table 2: Descriptive statistics about measures of Internet use and correlations among
them<p>
Note. Descriptive statistics are in raw units.  Measures were converted to a
log scale for correlations.<p>
Several of the teens discovered communication services that allowed them to
exchange messages with friends and strangers in real time (Internet Relay Chat
and various MUDs).  One girl who had never dated started dating a boy she met
over a chat service.  Because of what seemed to be almost addictive behavior
among some of the teenagers who used the real-time communication services,
several parents imposed limits on their children's computer use.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC12">Both
Mass Market and Individualized Information Services Have Appeal
</a></h3>
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC13">Directories
and popular culture 
</a></h4>
Only a few newsgroups and World Wide Web sites were popular with most
participants.  The most frequently accessed services were directories and
indexes, like Yahoo and Lycos, which provide taxonomies and search capabilities
for people to find information.  Directory and repository Web sites represented
half of the top 10 Web sites, ordered by number of users accessing each site.
Many participants accessed information about popular culture, including sports
and entertainment, from newsgroups and Web sites.  For example, men visited
sites that provided information about the Pittsburgh Penguins, Pirates and
Steelers, the local sports teams, and teens downloaded cartoons and songs from
rock groups.  One mother and her teenage-daughter regularly participated in a
newsgroup to keep up with the soap operas they missed. 
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC14">Sex</a></h4>
HomeNet participants also looked at sexually-oriented newsgroups, such as the
alt.sex.* hierarchy and the Web sites published by Penthouse and Playboy. When
newsgroups were ordered by the number of users who examined them one or more
times over the first 5 months of the study, 13 of the top 30 newsgroups had
sexual themes.  But the sexually-oriented newsgroups do not hold their readers.
When newsgroups were ordered by the number of "followers"-- users who read them
3 or more times over the 5 months--then only 4 of the top 30 of this group were
sexually oriented. Males were more likely to access these offerings than
females and teens of both genders accessed them more frequently than adults,
holding constant their overall use of the Internet.  But less than 50% of the
sample ever accessed a sexually-oriented newsgroup even once, and only 20%
accessed a sexually-oriented newsgroup three or more times.  <p>
When asked about their children's access to pornography on the net, parents
told us they trusted their children to avoid inappropriate content.  Some said
the sexually-oriented materials that they personally checked out were no worse
that the materials easily available to their children in the corner drug store.
It is unclear, however, how general are these attitudes, given our sample of
urban parents.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC15">Local
services  
</a></h4>
Local information and communication services had special appeal to participants
in the trial for two reasons.  First, times for movies houses, buses schedules,
and information on sports teams, social services and community development are
all more useful when they are local.  In one local newsgroup, teens from
several area high schools shared information about which Department of Motor
Vehicle testing station gave the easiest parallel parking tests. Local
information services also provide people with satisfying social identities.
People want to participate in and be part of groups, and geography provides one
basis for group formation.  Teenagers preferred communication forums that were
limited to their own high schools.  They complained when their communication
areas were "invaded" (their term) by interlopers from other schools, and asked
for controlled-access forums for their own groups.  
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC16">Individualized
services
</a></h4>
Although services providing directory information and information about popular
culture and the local environment appealed to many participants, the modal
information service appealed to only one or two participants.  The 126
participants who used the Internet accessed 1146 different newsgroups and more
than 4000 different Web sites. Of the 1146 newsgroups visited, 328 were
"followed"--accessed at least 3 or more times by at least one reader.  When
subset of newsgroups are ranked by number of followers, 78% were followed by
just one user and only 10% were followed by 3 or more users.  Similarly, 62% of
followed Web sites were followed by only 1 reader and 23% were followed by 3 or
more.<p>
The information services that appealed to one or two people were extremely
varied.  Newgroups ranged from those associated with hobbies (e.g.,
needlepoint) to religion (e.g., Jewish culture) to professions (e.g., tax
preparation).  
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC17">Internet
Use is Expressive
</a></h3>
Our discussion of using the Internet to this point has focused on interpersonal
communication as a way to build and maintain social relationships and on
information services as a way to become informed or entertained.  Participants
also used their computers and the Internet as ways to express themselves. Six
trial participants wrote their own World Wide Web home pages, one touting his
high school and another showing off his creative writing.  Besides this public
expression, some participants personalized their home computers by creating new
background patterns or substituting curses or musical phrases for the
traditional warning sounds.  Teenagers were most likely to engage in both types
of expression.  Many reported that mastering the techniques necessary to
personalize their computers was satisfying in its own right.  Most of the
adults whom we interviewed considered mastering these techniques to be a waste
of time and an obstacle to their use of the computer. <b></b><p>
<b></b>Communication networks have long been known as vehicles for people to
express themselves, for example, by assuming different personas in newsgroups
[4].  Among our sample, group communication was easier technically than
personalization of the computer (although we found in our home visits that some
participants had trouble locating desirable newsgroups and Web sites).  Both
adults and teens engaged in group communication, and many became consistent
members of virtual groups.  Teens who became relatively sophisticated computer
users gave advice in the HomeNet help group to strangers in the trial who were
having trouble. Several adults shared their professional expertise on
newsgroups: an accountant his tax knowledge and a doctor his knowledge of
arthritis. Others offered advice on their hobbies: one woman gave advice on
raising exotic pets. 
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC18">PREDICTORS
OF INTERNET USE
</a></h2>
We used linear regression analyses to identify the characteristics of HomeNet
participants that predicted Internet usage differences.  Because of the high
correlations among usage measures, our dependent variable in this analysis is a
composite, operationalized as the average of the standardized usage scores for
sending and receiving electronic mail, reading and posting in newsgroups, and
accessing World Wide Web sites (all in the log scale) across the first 5 months
of the study.  The predictor variables were measured on the pretrial
questionnaires, before participants had Internet access.  <p>
These variables were grouped into four categories for purposes of analysis
(Table 3).  The category boundaries are arbitrary, but generally conform to the
way home computing has been discussed in the literature, that is, as influenced
primarily by economic and demographic factors, psychological or personality
dispositions, computer skill and experience, and interest in various
information sources (e.g., [12],[14]). <p>
Below, we discuss each category of variables and the effects of each category
singly.  Then we construct an overall model, using all the significant
variables from the previous analyses.  This is an exploratory analysis, and
does not use strong theory to test a deductive model.  Also, it is a
preliminary analysis examining only main effects on aggregate use. In later
stages of this research we will investigate interactions, effects over time and
differential predictions for communication and information services.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC19">Demographics</a></h3>
Five demographic/economic variables are cited often in the literature on home
computing: income, education, race, gender, and generation.  
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC20">Income</a></h4>
Given the substantial investment required to purchase a computer, few families
with low incomes have one [1].  By making computers and Internet access
available to all participants in the trial, we are able to determine whether
income has an effect on using the Internet once families have passed the hurdle
of acquiring a computer. Household income was operationalized as the average of
the household incomes reported by adults in a family.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC21">Household
education
</a></h4>
Early adopters of home computing were well educated, professional people who
often used computers to  extend their work hours [14]. The task of purchasing
the right hardware and software package, assembling the computer at home, and
using the machine for useful purposes against the odds of breakdowns, was
daunting.  We made usability a strong goal in our trial, and asked whether
enhanced usability might reduce the impact of education on usage. Household
education was operationalized as the average of the highest grade completed by
the adults in the family.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC22">Race.</a></h4>
Home computers are less common in minority households than white ones, even
controlling for income and education [1].  It has been argued that minority
students do not have equal access to computing both at school and at home [10].
We tested if race difference in computing holds for home use of the Internet,
once families have acquired a computer. Race was treated as a binary variable,
coded as 1 for whites and 0 for others.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC23">Gender
</a></h4>
In schools, playrooms, and computer clusters, girls often do not seem as
attracted to computers as boys do.  A host of stereotypes including societal,
educational and familial attitudes are said be working against women in
computing [7].  We tested whether the gender gap often discussed in the
literature affected Internet use at home.  Gender was treated as a binary
variable, coded as 1 for males and 0 for females.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC24">Generation</a></h4>
A generation gap in adopting new technology seems as strong today as ever.
Youngsters and young people typically adopt many new electronic home
technologies (such as VCRs and Walkmen) well before adults.  We expected the
students in the sample to be heavier users of the Internet because they are
curious, have time for exploration, and have had some formal training on
computers. Generation was treated as a binary variable, 
<img src="rek_fg4.gif" alt="Table 3">

Table
3. Predicting Internet Use.<p>
Note. - Table entries are Beta coefficients for predicting Internet use.
Except for the binary variable of race, gender, and generation, the independent
variables have been standardized with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of
1. <i>P</i>-values are in parentheses.<p>
coded as 1 if a participant's age was 21 or greater and 0 otherwise.<p>
The second column of Table 3 shows how the demographic variables were related
to Internet usage in our sample.  Neither income nor education predicted usage.
This finding suggests strongly that once economic barriers are removed, people
across socioeconomic lines will use the Internet.  By contrast, race, gender,
and, especially, generation were strong predictors of Internet usage in our
sample: whites, males, and teens were more likely to use the Internet than
minorities, females, and adults, respectively.  These effects all speak to
strong cultural or social forces on Internet usage.  Of all the variables, the
difference between children and adults was the strongest predictor in the
category, and turned out to be the strongest predictor across all analyses.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC25">Psychological
dispositions
</a></h3>
We chose five variables within the category of psychological dispositions.  
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC26">Innovativeness</a></h4>
We measured people's willingness to experiment with new ideas and fashions.  We
adapted an innovativeness scale [8] used by marketing researchers to predict
people's adoption of new products and services (e.g., "I like to experiment
with new ways of doing things."; Cronbach's Alpha = .41).
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC27">Sociability
 
</a></h4>
Since several of the most popular services on the Internet support
interpersonal communication, we measured a person's tendency to socialize and
have social skills, adapting a social extroversion scale [2] (e.g., "I like to
mix socially with people."; Cronbach's Alpha = .74).  
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC28">Hassles
 
</a></h4>
Hassles are problems in daily life ranging from one's car breaking down to
one's child getting sick at school.  We speculated that those with a more
harried lifestyle would be less likely to learn and use the Internet.  This
measure is the number of daily hassles each subject reported in the week prior
to the pretrial survey [6].
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC29">Time
pressure
</a></h4>
People with too many responsibilities and little free time are unlikely to have
the slack resources necessary to learn a  new technology or to explore its
value.  We measured time pressure by adapting a scale measuring overload in
organizations [3] (e.g., "I often feel under stress because I don't have enough
time."; Cronbach's Alpha = .74).
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC30">Depression
</a></h4>
The Internet could provide social support for those who lack it locally.  We
measured depression to investigate whether those measuring higher on this
variable would be more likely to use the Internet to try to obtain support.  It
is possible, however, that the lack of energy and enthusiasm associated with
depression would inhibit people from using the Internet.  Our measure of
depression  was taken from [9]. (e.g., "I felt sad"; Cronbach's Alpha = .83)<p>
The results of this analysis, shown in the third column of Table 3, are that
innovative and sociable people used the Internet more, and those who listed
many hassles used the Internet less.  People under time pressure did not use
the Internet less than people with more free time.  (This result is the same
when we used time diary data on hours spent at work or school.) Also, depressed
people used the Internet more than those who were not depressed.
Innovativeness and sociability are correlated with healthy psychological status
whereas depression is not.  These results suggest that the Internet appeals to
people at both ends of the continuum of psychological status, perhaps for
different reasons.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC31">Computer
experience and attitudes
</a></h3>
The literature on individual differences in computing performance strongly
suggests that technical abilities, experience, and attitudes will predict
Internet usage.

Skills

People with good computer skills should have an advantage in attempting to use
the Internet, if only because they can deal with some of the technical problems
that invariably arise. We developed a five-item scale to measure perceived
computer skills. (e.g., "I am very skilled at using computers."; Cronbach's
Alpha = .86).
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC33">Computer
Experience 
</a></h4>
People with more years of experience also might have an advantage in using the
Internet.  Our computer experience measure is the number of years participants
reported using computers.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC34">Computer
Value  
</a></h4>
People with more favorable attitudes about the usefulness of computers for
work, communication, entertainment, education, and other functions, might use
the Internet more. We developed a scale with twelve items to measure the
perceived usefulness of home computers across several domains. (Cronbach's
Alpha = .83) <b></b>
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC35">Value
of Computer Applications
</a></h4>
This construct measured directly the perceived value of popular computer
applications, such as word processing, spreadsheets and games as well as
networked applications such as e-mail, newsgroups, and file downloading
(Cronbach's Alpha = .76).<p>
People with more skill used the Internet more, but surprisingly, people with
greater experience with a computer used the Internet less, holding constant
their skill. (See the fourth column of Table 3.) Possibly the Internet appealed
to veteran computer users less than to novices because exploring computers was
less of a novelty.  Or, veterans' might have developed an instrumental view of
computing, a view inconsistent with the communication, casual exchange of
information, and fun that they saw in the Internet culture.  The perceived
usefulness of computers and applications was unrelated to participants' use of
the Internet.  
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC36">Use
of other media
</a></h3>
The Internet may serve as an alternative for other media such as books,
telephones, newspapers and TV.  Previous literature suggests both substitution
and complementarity (e.g., [12]).  However, this earlier research did not test
whether, for example, TV watchers avoid computers or whether computers pull
people away from their TVs.  To test this hypothesis, we measured the times per
week participants used a home telephone, read a newspaper, read a book,
listened to music, and  watched TV.<p>
People who read books were more likely to use the Internet, whereas people who
watched TV were less likely to use it. (See the fifth column in Table 3.)  The
text-based nature of most services on the Internet may appeal most to people
who read for information and entertainment. 
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC37">Overall
Model
</a></h3>
We constructed a combined model predicting Internet usage in our sample, by
including variables from the previous analyses that significantly predicted
use. The model explains 45% of the variance in participants' use of a range of
Internet services. Generation is the strongest individual predictor; teenagers
were much more likely to use the Internet than adults. Race is the second
strongest predictor; whites use the Internet more than minorities. This race
effect is strongest among the teens (analysis is not shown). Similarly, females
used the Internet less than males, and again the effect is largest among the
teens (not shown). <p>
Entering the demographic variables into the model reduces the effects of all
the psychological dispositions, although participants' innovativeness reliably
predicts their Internet use. Among the computer variables, those with more
computer skill used the Internet more, whereas those with more computer
experience used it less.  Finally, people who watch TV were less likely to use
the Internet.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC38">CONCLUSION</a></h2>
When ordinary people are given access to the Internet from home, half of them
use it regularly after 5 months.  Teenagers are central to Internet use at
home, at least in the present sample.  They often provided the motivation for
their parents to invest in a computer, were often the heaviest users in the
family, became sources of expertise within the household, and catalyzed
Internet use by other family members. If these findings are generally true,
then the family dynamics that characterize teenagers' interactions within
families will influence the diffusion of home computing.<p>
Though studies show that high-income, educated white males dominate the
Internet, the HomeNet study shows that once financial barriers are lowered,
lower income and less well educated people are as likely to become enthusiasts.
Race and gender, however, remain associated with Internet usage, perhaps
because the Internet's mainly white, male users has created a resource
environment most attractive to men and whites.  (One HomeNet women complained
that there was so much football and so little about fashions on the Web.) The
bias in Internet resources might change if more women and minorities sign on.<p>
HomeNet participants communicated heavily and used a wide range of information
services. Only a few of the information services were broadly popular. People
gravitate towards services that address their idiosyncratic interests.  Since
most individuals will be interested in only a few of the thousands of services
offered them, they need easy ways to personalize their information space so
that it reflects their interests as the interests and their resources change
over time.<p>
This report on the HomeNet project is preliminary.  Later reports will include
a larger sample, and will focus on family interactions, on dynamic processes,
on use over time of different electronic services, and on the impact of
Internet use on individuals, groups, and families. Additional documents about
HomeNet are at: <tt>http://homenet.andrew.cmu.edu/Progress/.</tt>
