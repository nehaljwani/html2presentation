<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>

In this methodology paper we define a metric we call
impact ratio. We use this ratio to measure the effectiveness
of inspections and other evaluative techniques in getting
usability improvements into products. We inspected ten
commercial software products and achieved an average
impact ratio of 78%. We discuss factors affecting this ratio
and its value in helping us to appraise usability
engineering's impact on products.

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

Usability as a discipline, and usability organizations, face
the challenge of measuring the effectiveness of the
methods they use. The possibility of making such
measurements varies with the type of work. For long-term
consulting work, where usability consultants work as
members of a development team from its inception, the
relative contributions of usability professionals versus
other contributors is difficult to distinguish. However, in
the case of more tightly-focused, shorter-term methods, the
ability to measure effectiveness is substantially higher
because these projects offer the possibility of a before-
intervention versus after-intervention comparison. One can
assess an interface and collect such metrics as number of
problems uncovered [6] or measure improvements in user
performance [1, 16]. In addition, one can measure the
relative effectiveness of one method over another [7, 8].
While these kinds of measures help usability professionals
decide on the optimal method for their situation, they do
not measure the effectiveness of any given method's ability
to leverage product improvement.
<P>
Recent papers have begun discussing the need to measure
the number of changes made to products as a result of a
usability method [1, 5, 16]. We suggest that including the
number of problems fixed is a more complete way of
measuring the impact of usability activities.
<P>
The Usability Expertise Center offers both short-term and
long-term consulting on usability issues within Digital
Equipment Corporation. Our long-term work is often
strategic in nature. This paper focuses on our activity as
short-term consultants, called on by a development group
to measure and improve the usability of a product by
applying focused, well-defined tactical methods to achieve
a quick result. In a tactical setting, the client needs specific
suggestions that will solve specific problems. In other
words, they need impact. Contributing to our need to
measure our effectiveness is our own management who
must be shown that we have a positive, measurable impact
on the usability of the company's products. We must,
therefore, measure the impact we have had on products to
show that we accomplished something and to understand
where we can be more effective [11].
<P>
In this paper we list a number of projects we have done,
showing how many problems we found and how many of
those problems were fixed by the development groups. We
look at a few of these projects in detail by way of example
to understand our relative impact and the factors
contributing to it. Finally we describe conclusions about
impact, which we have drawn based on all the projects
we've listed. Although the projects we discuss here
involved usability inspections, we believe the measurement
of impact applies to any usability evaluation method.

<H2>FINDING THE PROBLEMS</H2>

One of our primary responsibilities as usability
professionals is to find problems in user interfaces. A good
deal of attention has been focused on efficient and effective
ways to find all of the problems that exist in a given
interface. Nielsen has nicely summarized these methods
[12].
<P>
In the Usability Expertise Center at Digital, we make
frequent use of user testing and usability inspections.
These methods often find different problems, so that the
best coverage of a product results from using both methods
[3, 8]. In practice we are usually constrained by
development-group budget and preference to one or the
other. To those clients who are short on time (and budget)
and who value &quot;expert opinion&quot;, we suggest an inspection.
Inspections take less time. To those clients who have a
little more time and budget or who do not value the
opinions of experts, we suggest user testing. (However we
find that we can often insert a little expert opinion into
user testing.)
<P>
In the past we had been asked to do reviews of designs. We
did these reviews, but there was no follow-up so we had no
idea of how effective the review was. Since usability is a
scarce resource, we decided to institute a structured process
to assess our effectiveness and to winnow out any client
groups who were asking for input that they did not plan to
use. Specifically we decided to adopt a review format
similar to that used in software code inspections. [18]
<P>
Here is our standard procedure for doing an inspection.
<OL>
<LI>After talking with the client, we give them a written
proposal that states which parts of the product we will
inspect and which aspects of usability we will cover.
Our coverage can include general usability principles,
style-guide compliance, visual design principles, and
online information (help and tutorials) principles.

<LI>We provide the client with a document describing the
principles on which we base our inspection.

<LI>Our proposal states that we will provide a written
report enumerating problems found and including for
each problem the severity (with a specific scale), the
specific principles violated, and a recommendation for
ways to fix the problem.

<LI>The proposal further states that the client must make a
written response that includes, for each problem: a
statement of whether they will fix the problem
immediately or in a later release or not at all; if not at
all, why not; an estimate of the work required to fix the
problem; and a statement of what fix they will use (our
recommendation or their own alternative).

<LI>We have pairs of inspectors work as a team on each
aspect of usability to be evaluated. (Although Nielsen
discusses the advantages of multiple inspectors [13, 14,
15], he has evaluators work independently to ensure
that one does not bias the other. This produces greater
variability in the kinds of errors found.) Our experience
is that having inspectors look at the interface together
results in finding more problems and suggesting better
solutions than if the inspectors work alone. However,
having more inspectors is not necessarily better. We
also find that two is the optimal number for interacting
with each other and recording the findings efficiently.
With more than two, the person taking notes becomes a
bottleneck and the other inspectors become bored.

<LI>One person compiles a single report from all of the
inspection comments from each pair of inspectors.

<LI>All inspectors review the final report and, if necessary,
meet to resolve any gaps, contradictions, or
disagreements.

<LI>We give this written report to the client team to read
and act on, and if we are suggesting major design
changes, we may walk through the suggested new
design with the client team.

<LI>We use the feedback from the development group to
evaluate our impact and to look for ways to improve
our process.
</OL>

<H2>HOW WE MEASURED IMPACT</H2>

As described above, we require the client to provide a
written response. From that report we measure the number
of problems that the client commits to fixing. We define a
metric called impact ratio as the number of problems that
the client commits to fix divided by the total number of
problems that we found, expressed as a percentage:
<P>
<PRE><B>
               problems committed to fix
impact ratio = -------------------------  * 100
                 total problems found
</B></PRE>

<H2>FINDINGS</H2>

Table 1 summarizes our activity on ten projects. These
inspections took place from August of 1994 to September
of 1995 and represent all of the inspections that we
delivered to clients during this time that used this
framework. The table shows the result of these usability
inspections ranked in descending order based on their
impact ratios. The average number of usability problems
found is 66 with a range of 26 to 111. The average number
of committed fixes is 52 with a range of 24 to 84. The
average Committed Impact Ratio is 78% with a range of
58% to 96%.

<P>
A salient feature of the committed impact ratio is that it
measures a commitment that we get from product
development. One might wonder if this commitment is
predictive of the actual number of fixes. For six usability
inspections, we have had access to the version of the
product produced after our inspection. This allowed us to
see which usability issues development actually addressed.
<P>
When evaluating the number of usability issues fixed, it is
important to keep in mind that product development is an
ongoing process. Issues that are not addressed in one
version of a product are sometimes deferred to another
version. Therefore, a seemingly large divergence between
the committed impact ratio and the completed-to-date
impact ratio does not invalidate the committed impact
ratio. The completed-to-date impact ratio is a measure of
how far the development team has come towards
addressing all of the problems identified.
<P>
For five out of the six inspections, the committed impact
ratios are the same as the completed-to-date. The reasons
for this reside in the pressures of the software development
environment. In some cases, because of compressed
schedules and the need to ship, developers implemented
our recommendations before reporting back to us, so their
reports reflected what they had actually done. This is an
example of developments propensity to not commit to
anything until they are sure they can do it.
<P>
For product G the response from development showed a
committed impact ratio of 71%; however, when we were
able to follow-up on the product, the actual number of
recommendations implemented resulted in a completed-to-
date impact ratio of only 37%. This ratio was partly due to
the nature of the recommendations. For example, one
recommendation was to implement mnemonics for every
button in the interface. Developing a set of mnemonics for
an interface requires some thought and planning, in
addition to the actual coding. Other recommendations
affected the entire interface. These included changing the
action of scroll bars, providing progress indicators, making
buttons, labels and placement consistent, allowing for
maximizing and minimizing windows, and providing a
task-oriented help system. Recommendations from our
inspection represented only one set of pressures on the
developers. Other pressures included the need to
implement new features, fix bugs, and meet their deadlines
for each release. The way that this development team
balanced the demands was by staging their approach to
implementing the usability recommendations over more
than one version. and by placing a higher priority on
software bugs than usability issues.
<P>
Gunn [5] reported that 14 inspections produced an average
fix rate of 74% with a range of 50% to 95%. In addition,
Muller [10] reported for one heuristic evaluation that 89
recommendations were made, 87% were committed to and
72% were actually implemented.
<P>
Our data as well as that of Gunn [5] demonstrate that
formal inspections are a relatively effective method of
getting usability problems fixed. These findings qualify
Klemmer's [9] assertion that expert opinion is not as
effective as data from usability studies in facilitating
product improvement and suggest that, when embedded in
an appropriate process, expert opinion can be quite
effective.

<H2>WHAT AFFECTS IMPACT</H2>

There are a number of factors that affect the impact of a
usability method. The following is a discussion of some of
these factors, based on our experiences delivering
inspections and our reflection on these experiences.

<H3>Written Report</H3>

Providing a written report has an obvious positive effect on
our impact: The problem descriptions and specific
solutions are available for all group members to read and
reference, and the written word removes some (but not all)
ambiguity about what we intend to say. The written report
also has a less-obvious effect that has been reported earlier
[18]: We avoid being used as an approval agency, wherein
our recommendations may be ignored while &quot;usability
approval&quot; is cited. In such situations, our impact would
actually be negative: no changes would be made, and the
incentive to make changes would be lessened.

<H3>Multiple Methods</H3>

Since inspections and user tests are known often to
discover different problems [6], a way to improve impact is
to do both kinds (or other kinds) of evaluations. It should
be noted that inspections usually provide more systematic
coverage of an interface than user testing.

<H3>Written Response</H3>

Requiring a client to respond in writing to our report
changes the client's response. We ask our clients to include
a work-time estimate for each problem fix as part of their
response. Having invested the time to consider each
problem, its fix, and the time required to implement it,
development groups tend to actually do what they tell us
they will do, though we have no authority to ask for
commitments. This is the request form of speech acts [17]
which provides for a clear specification of action, a
responsible person, and a date to be completed.
<P>
In addition, requesting engineering to agree to respond to
our report in writing often helps us to eliminate clients
who are unlikely to implement our recommendations. That
is, if they cannot agree to respond to our report, it follows
that they probably will not have time to implement our
recommendations either. Therefore the context in which
we measure our impact actually helps us to identify
optimal ways to apply our resources.
<P>
We find that requiring a written response from a
development team is good practice for any usability
technique. It is also one of the operational aspects of any
kind of engineering. [16].

<H3>Easier Response Process</H3>

Client responses are important, but we know that they
impose additional work on engineering. Therefore, we try
to make the process easier. One way we do this is to set up
a meeting where we go over the report with the client. We
answer any questions they might have about the
recommendations and they give us their response to each
recommendation, which we record on the spot. Sometimes
we provide our report document to clients so they can add
their information to the report without having to reference
each recommendation in a separate file. We are usually
willing to adapt our process to achieve our desired result.

<H3>Specific Recommendations </H3>

Providing specific recommendations to fix specific
problems has a tremendous positive effect: The
development group need not spend time thinking of a
solution, plus we gain a psychological advantage in
offering constructive suggestions rather than just criticism.
To the extent that we have the expertise, we include
enough technical details in our recommendations so that
the solution becomes &quot;a mere matter of coding.&quot; Modern
GUI toolkits are complicated, and many development
groups do not have a GUI guru available, so we can often
provide enough details to change a programmer's estimate
from &quot;Can't do that&quot; or &quot;That would take
a month&quot; to &quot;I can have that done tomorrow&quot;.
<P>
Along that line, we sometimes offer two or more
recommendations to solve a given problem, suggesting a
better but more complex solution if there is time and talent
available, and a less desirable but still acceptable solution
that can be implemented more quickly. Some impact is
definitely better than no impact.

<H3>Severity Level</H3>

We rate each problem found with a severity level of low,
medium, or high according to that problem's effect on
usability. This allows the development group to focus on
the fixes that will have the most usability impact. We have
found, however, that the severity of the issues that we
report does not appear to have any effect on whether or not
development will commit to addressing an issue. For the
inspections shown in Table 1, the impact ratio for high,
medium, and low usability issues is 72%, 71% and 72%
respectively. This finding suggests the need to further
examine the reporting of severity levels to learn if other
factors (such as time, effort, and risk involved in
addressing an issue) influence whether or not development
will commit to addressing a usability issue.
<P>
We find that reporting severity makes our report more like
engineering quality assurance reports and as a result adds
more credibility to our process and findings. Therefore we
will continue reporting severity levels.
<P>
We also encourage developers to go for some &quot;cheap
wins,&quot; problems that are easy to fix irrespective of severity.
When a number of &quot;cheap wins&quot; are aggregated, the result
can be a significant improvement in the perceived quality
of the interface.

<H3>Client Participation</H3>

Having a member of the client development team sit in on
an inspection or user test sometimes has a big impact.
Karat has observed [7] that this is due to the &quot;seeing is
believing&quot; phenomenon and the developer's involvement
in and commitment to the usability evaluation process. We
affirm this observation, noting that some developers and
managers do not value expert opinion at all, so direct
participation gives them assurance that the data we collect
is credible. [4, 18]

<H3>Early Involvement</H3>

An obvious factor for impact is being able to work with a
development group as early in the development cycle as
possible, since it is well known that solving quality
problems (whether software bugs or usability bugs) earlier
is cheaper. We have less control over this factor, but we
have found that we get a fair bit of repeat business from
satisfied clients, and that our involvement with the next
project for a client often happens earlier in the
development cycle. Earlier involvement is, of course,
advantageous to the client: inspections and user testing
operate in a scrap and rework mode, so from a larger
perspective they are less efficient than an approach which
focuses on getting the design right earlier in the process.
One might think of inspections as both a short-term aid to
usability  and a long-term investment in changing
development processes.

<H2>FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL</H2>

Some factors that affect impact are beyond our control.
Although we believe that usability problems are real bugs
and can often convince development groups of this,
usability bugs most often are given lower priority in
comparison to software bugs, for a good reason: if the
product doesn't work, usability doesn't matter much. For
products that have a high number of software bugs, impact
from usability evaluations is likely to be low.
<P>
The following are reasons for not implementing a
recommendation that we feel are beyond the control of
usability practitioners:
<UL>
<LI>The development team did not have enough time or
resources to implement the change. Shipping the
product is the highest priority.

<LI>Implementing the recommendation would have a
negative impact on performance.

<LI>The product was canceled.

<LI>The problem existed only in prototype code and not in
the actual product. When we compute the impact ratio
for an inspection of a prototype, we base the impact
ratio on the number of valid recommendations. That
is, we subtract from the total number of problems
identified any that were invalid because they described
problems existing only in the prototype.
</UL>

<H2>FACTORS AFFECTING SPECIFIC INSPECTIONS</H2>

A number of factors contributed to the high impact ratios
of 92% and 91% for products A and B. Both of the
products are part of a tightly integrated product set. The
usability engineers who participated in the inspection
enjoyed a long-term relationship with the development
group and had earned the respect of the developers. The
usability engineers worked on an ongoing basis with the
developers, performing many kinds of usability processes
and evaluations at various points in the development cycle.
However, the inspections noted here were the first formal
inspections performed in that product space. Previously a
single usability engineer might review an interface and
provide feedback to the developers. Formal inspections
were a departure from the existing process because
usability engineers worked as a team to review the
interface and requested a written response from
engineering. The novelty of the formal inspection process
generated a lot of excitement and interest. Working as a
team, the usability engineers were able to produce a
comprehensive report in a relatively short time. The report
categorized usability issues by screen and severity ratings.
The development teams were pleased to be able to get
usability feedback in time for current releases and the
severity ratings helped them to focus on the most pressing
issues.
<P>
Another factor contributing to the high success rate for the
inspection of Product B (91% impact ratio) was that the
development team was located in Valbonne, France and
was appreciative of having the spotlight of attention from
the &quot;home office&quot; focused on their product. Being in the
spotlight might have also encouraged them to higher levels
of cooperation.
<P>
On the other hand, a completely different set of factors
contributed to the low impact ratio of Product H (66%
impact ratio). The developer responsible for the first
version was reassigned to another product. The new
developer who was finally assigned lacked vital product
knowledge and expertise to address the usability issues. In
addition, the future of the product was uncertain because
high-level strategy decisions were threatening to render it
obsolete. Therefore development was unwilling to invest a
lot of resources on the product unless its future was more
certain. For future projects we will ask questions during
our initial contact with clients to determine how stable a
product is before we commit to performing an inspection
on it. This will help us to avoid performing inspections on
products to which development is not fully committed.
<P>
Here are some of the factors contributing to the 58%
impact ratio of Product I. It is intended for internal use.
The initial client request was for specific consultation on
Motif style guide issues, but in looking at the interface
with the client to understand the Motif issues, our
consultant observed several usability problems that were
not related to style-guide compliance. We suggested an
inspection. The development manager acknowledged that
the product had not had any involvement of a design
professional, and that there were likely many problems that
would not be observed until the product was actually
deployed, so the manager was enthusiastic about an
inspection. The inspection was done in our standard way
(described earlier), and the client requested a consultation
meeting to clarify some of the recommendations made.
<P>
When the client response came back, we discovered that
our impact had been lower than usual. Analysis of the
specific responses revealed several factors. Development
time and resources were very limited, so most work was
deferred to a later release. The developers had some
strongly-held beliefs on how Motif applications are
supposed to work, at least partly based on the default
behavior of several Motif widgets. But the largest single
factor was a strongly-held belief that users of the product
must be domain experts (in an aspect of the company's
business) and must undergo training before using the
product. Although we demonstrated alternative designs
that were not especially difficult to implement and that
would remove the training requirement, the development
team opted to assume the need for training (adding to the
cost of use for every product user) in order to reduce their
development cost (since they had already implemented the
products). Only strong user criticism has a chance of
changing their minds on this issue.

<H2>WAYS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE OUR IMPACT</H2>

Reflection on our processes has shown us that many factors
affect our impact. This section describes some process
improvements that resulted from analyzing the written
responses from product development.
<P>
The following are reasons that clients gave us for not
implementing our recommendations that we feel are within
the control of usability practitioners:
<UL>
<LI>The recommendation is not in keeping with product
goals. This reason was the most common reason that
we encountered. It occurred in development responses
from seven of the ten studies. It reveals the need for
usability engineers to take more time to become
familiar with the products they evaluate. They could
do this by reviewing product brochures and product
descriptions before beginning the inspection.

<LI>The recommendation would make this component
inconsistent with other components in the product
family. If a product is one of a family of products,
usability engineers could request access to the entire
family, or at least major components. They could then
reference other components to ensure that they do not
make recommendations that compromise consistency
in the product family.

<LI>Product developers expressed strong (erroneous)
opinion that the current implementation is
satisfactory. Developers gave this as the reason for not
implementing recommendations in half of the studies.
The best way to counter this kind of complacency with
the product is with usability testing rather than
inspection methods. Expert opinion, one
distinguishing characteristic of inspection methods, is
only as effective as development's willingness to
accept it. [2]

<LI>The software platform or development tool seems to
impose restrictions. This reason was present in the
responses of five of the ten usability studies. Often the
restriction is real. However, just as frequently,
implementation requires a complex solution of which
the developer is unaware. Usability engineers with
technical expertise can influence a positive decision by
describing a workable solution.

The impact ratio is a quantitative measure of how many of
our recommendations the development team will
implement. It provides us feedback on how we are doing.
However, it is only a metric and not an end in itself. For
example, we frequently make recommendations even when
we are unsure whether a problem exists. We feel obligated
to bring these kinds of ambiguous issues to the attention of
the developers, even if there is a chance that they will not
accept the recommendation and thus reduce our impact
ratio. We do not limit our reports to items that we are sure
development will address.

<H2>CONCLUSION</H2>

It is important for usability professionals to find usability
problems quickly and effectively, but it is equally
important to have an impact on the usability of products
examined and to reflect on the effectiveness of usability
practice. We have described here a simple way to measure
the probable impact on product usability by (1) producing a
written report, (2) requiring a response from the client, and
(3) calculating the ratio of problems the client says will be
fixed to the total number of problems found.
<P>
We have also described factors that we have found affect
our impact: (1) providing severity levels for problems;
(2) making recommendations that are both detailed and
technically-specific; (3) requiring a client response;
(4) getting involved as early as possible, (5) becoming
familiar with the product and its design goals prior to the
inspection, and (6) inspecting the product within the
context of its product family.
<P>
Using these methods, we have satisfied our clients,
improved the usability of our company's products, and
measurably justified our existence to our management. In
addition, we now have a database of results to which we
can compare future evaluations to spot deviant cases and
investigate them.
