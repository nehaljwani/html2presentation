<h2> ABSTRACT</h2>


<a name="106357">

Designers of system prompts for interactive spoken-language systems
typically seek 1) to constrain users so that they say things that the
system can understand accurately and 2) to produce ``natural''
interaction that maximizes users' satisfaction. Unfortunately, these
goals are often at odds. <p>

</a>

<a name="112772">

We present a set of heuristics for choosing appropriate prompt styles
and show that a set of dimensions can be formulated from these
heuristics. A point (or region) in the space formed by these
dimensions is a ``style'' for prompts. We develop and apply metrics
for empirically testing different prompt styles. Finally, we describe
a toolkit that automatically generates prompts in a variety of styles
for spoken-language dialogues.<p>

<h2> INTRODUCTION</h2>

</a>

<a name="106374">

Between the attainable practicality of command-based speech
recognition and the elusive attraction of ``natural'' spoken-language
interaction lies the growing use of spoken dialogue systems (SDSs).
This middle ground includes applications such as the AT&amp;T
long-distance billing system, the OGI automated spoken questionnaire
for the U.S. Census [6], and systems performing the ATIS travel
information task [15]. These systems engage in relatively simple
task-based dialogues, often expecting users' utterances to consist of
a single word or a short phrase; they are analogous in complexity to
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Like GUIs, SDSs generally do not
generate their output at run time; they instead use pre-specified
phrases or templates as prompts. Development of these prompts is
usually taken to be more art than science; to create the system's
prompts, designers most often rely on expert intuition and tacit
experience. But beyond intuition and experience we propose systematic
methods for characterizing and generating spoken-dialogue prompts. In
this paper, we present these methods and show their usefulness for
developing effective SDSs. Although we concentrate on SDS development,
these methods have a natural extension to the speech component of
multimedia systems.<p>

</a>

<a name="106375">

For effective interaction, SDSs must rely on directive prompts [7] to
increase user compliance with system requirements. The best
intuitively-designed prompts serve two functions though: they not only
constrain the user's response so that speech recognizers--all too
fallible--stand a better chance of success, but also provide a feeling
of ``natural'' dialogue for the user so that the overall interaction
is not aversive. These two functions provide a basis for a more
systematic approach to generation of prompts. From our own experiences
in designing SDSs, we have developed a set of heuristics for designing
system output. From these heuristics, we have further developed a
framework for analyzing and designing prompts in terms of dimensions,
features and styles. <p>

</a>

<a name="112470">

Our interest in identifying dimensions of dialogue variation grew out
of our need to translate a written questionnaire for the US Census
(the 1990 Census Short Form) into a configuration usable with a SDS.
The first problem we encountered was a proliferation of possible ways
of structuring and phrasing census questions. For each written
question, there seemed a nearly infinite variety of ways of expressing
its underlying meaning to users. We needed a way to choose only a few
representatives from the profusion of conceivable treatments; we could
not test the effectiveness of every variation and needed to converge
quickly on solutions better suited to SDS technology. Unfortunately we
did not know, a priori, which solutions would be best. To ensure
adequate performance of the speech recognition component of a SDS,
while avoiding confusing or alienating users, we needed to find a way
to characterize the ``space'' of ways to formulate questions, and to
predict the results obtained by using prompts in different points of
that space.<p>

</a>

<a name="108740">

We derive a space of possible system prompts by first producing and
analyzing heuristics offering different treatments, or styles, for
handling various aspects of spoken interaction. These styles suggest
several ways to present automated human-computer dialogues, with an
emphasis on the ways of phrasing system prompts. By abstracting across
the heuristics, we have identified a set of features associated with
each style, and a set of dimensions covering and containing the
feature set. A point in the space described by the dimensions is a
``style'' for prompts. <p>

</a>

<a name="112476">

In this paper, we present a framework of heuristics, dimensions and
styles for spoken dialogue prompts. We define the notion of a SDS's
overall stylistic consistency. We outline metrics for empirically
testing different prompt styles in terms of their effects on
constraint of user speech and on user satisfaction, and briefly
present results of our use of this approach. Finally, we describe a
SDS toolkit we are developing that incorporates some of this framework
in the automated generation of system prompts.<p>

<h2> THE PROBLEM</h2>

</a>

<a name="106393">

Current speech recognition algorithms match the features of a speech
signal with models of the features of known phonemes via a statistical
process. One effect of this statistical matching is that recognition
is probabilistic. In a GUI, only the set of relevant user actions are
defined at any given moment. This is equivalent to imposing a
vocabulary of legal actions. It is generally not possible to enforce
the same rigid constraints in a spoken interface. Unfortunately, the
need for a high-degree of recognition accuracy in speaker-independent
speech recognition imposes the requirement that the words to be
recognized come from a relatively small set of candidates. The overall
effectiveness [8] of a SDS, then, is dependent upon the ability of
dialogue designers to produce prompts that constrain users' possible
responses. One of the subtleties of dialogue design lies in giving
users a feeling of naturalness and freedom of response although
underlying constraints exist. <p>

</a>

<a name="111146">

In an ideal SDS, the naturalness and accuracy criteria would both be
satisfied. Users would be free from artificial constraints on their
use of vocabulary, grammar, or the interactional fluidity that
characterize routine task-based human-human telephone speech.
Unfortunately, this ideal is unrealistic given current technology
[5,12,13]. Indeed, given the limitations inherent in current speech
recognition technology and the need for near-perfect recognition
accuracy, dialogue designers must often make compromises between
accuracy and naturalness. While these criteria may sometimes agree on
the best way to present system prompts, most often a tension exists
between them.<p>

</a>

<a name="112760">

We have used different versions of dialogues to refine our
understanding of this tension. Consider, for example, a dialogue in
which the system sought to elicit certain information from the user by
asking only yes/no questions. Such an approach would likely be very
accurate from a speech recognition standpoint, yet fairly unnatural
and inappropriate for many situations. Determining a user's age by
means of yes/no questions, for example, would most certainly be a
laborious and unacceptable approach, unpleasant for the user and
time-consuming for both user and system. <p>

</a>

<a name="112761">

Finally, where limits of speech recognition technology force dialogue
designers to adopt solutions that are not maximally pleasing or
natural, it is essential that they have a clear understanding of the
implications of the compromises they make. Only then are they in a
position to take advantage of improvements in the accuracy and
robustness of that technology as they become available.<p>

<h2> HEURISTICS, DIMENSIONS AND STYLES</h2>

</a>

<a name="107519">

To advance the production of voice-response questionnaires from an ad
hoc, mostly intuitive ``craft'' into more of an engineering
discipline, we have developed a method using a set of heuristics for
transforming [16] a written version of a questionnaire into a script
(or protocol) for use with speech-recognition systems. From these
heuristics, we then developed a systematic approach to the design of
spoken prompts; this approach is based on defining a space of possible
system prompts that can be described by a set of task-independent
descriptive dimensions. We identify a set of fourteen dimensions of
system prompts, and define a point in the space they form as a
``style'' for prompts. <p>

</a>

<a name="106455">

<h2> Heuristics for Designing Dialogues</h2>

</a>

<a name="106457">

In designing prompts for the census task, we quickly saw that for each
question there was a myriad of ways of expressing its underlying
intent. To converge on a practical number of dialogue designs to test,
we needed a principled way of deciding which, out of thousands of
wording variations, we should use. One limiting factor for this
particular project derived from the nature of the census task itself:
we needed the spoken questionnaire to be as true to the original
written form as possible in order to avoid distorting census results.
This concern led us to examine ways of transforming the original
written questionnaire into a form suitable for use with a SDS. One
result of our investigation was a set of heuristics for translating
from written to spoken media.<p>

</a>

<a name="106458">

Associated with each heuristic are 1) a pattern, or a set of
pre-conditions, specifying where the heuristic may be used; 2) a set
of styles into which a question (or other aspect of the interaction)
can be transformed; and 3) a discussion of the trade-offs between the
styles. The discussions of the trade-offs constitute informal
hypotheses about the effects of the different styles on the accuracy
of speech recognition, the naturalness of the interaction, and the
interaction's length. As an example, consider a heuristic applicable
to multiple-choice questions (described below). This heuristic applies
when transforming, from written to spoken form, questions involving a
choice among three to six options. We have informally specified five
different styles of structuring and phrasing such questions, and have
analyzed their implications on speech recognition accuracy as well as
their expected effect on the naturalness and length of the
interaction. <p>

</a>

<a name="106459">

The styles associated with each heuristic are representative samples,
depicting not every way of phrasing or presenting prompts but rather a
reasonable breadth of approaches. Although many of the heuristics are
associated with the forms that questions may take, some are applicable
to the interaction as a whole or to a particular aspect of
interaction, such as ways of accomplishing turn-taking. Multiple
heuristics may apply to a single prompt and, in the case of heuristics
describing the re-structuring of complex questions, may be cascaded;
one heuristic may partially break down the question while another may
finish the translation. <p>

</a>

<a name="106460">

We developed these heuristics in order to provide a principled
starting point for an iterative dialogue design prototyping effort,
but their value is not limited to this particular usage. In general,
the prompt heuristics have several important uses, including: <p>

</a>

<ul>

<ul>

<a name="112504">

<li>developing designs for a set of initial dialogues,

</a>

<a name="112505">

<li>categorizing existing dialogues,

</a>

<a name="112506">

<li>testing hypotheses about the effectiveness and naturalness of
different styles, and

</a>

<li>implementation via rapid prototyping toolkits.

</a>

</ul>

</ul>

<a name="112540">

<p>

</a>

<a name="112541">

In our efforts, these heuristics have been useful for reducing the
expected user vocabulary, reducing the effects of user intonation,
mitigating the reduced level of system's understanding and interactive
abilities, and compensating for the loss of visual access to the
written form (including the ability to scan ahead) [3]. Perhaps the
greatest benefit of this framework is that it encourages an empirical
approach to dialogue design. By making and testing predictions about
the effects of various styles, we can reject inappropriate dialogue
styles and reduce the dialogue designer's reliance on intuition and
hand-crafting.<p>

</a>

<a name="106466">

The following sections describe individual heuristics we devised in
the course of the census project. In many cases the styles associated
with a heuristic are presented as hypothetical interactions between
the system (``S'') and a user (``U'').<p>

<h3> Questions Containing Presuppositions</h3>

</a>

<a name="106503">

Figure 1 depicts two different styles for dealing with questions
containing presuppositions. Style 1.1 ignores the possibility of a
question eliciting an unexpected response due to an invalid
presupposition on the systems's part.<p>

<P><HR>

<pre>
Style 1.1:	S: What is your home phone number (including area code)?
		U: I don't have a phone.

Style 1.2:	S: Do you have a home phone number?
		U: Yes.
		S: What is your home phone number (including area code)?
		U: &lt;telephone number&gt;
</pre>
<h3> Figure 1: Questions containing presuppositions</h3>

<p><hr><P>

</a>

<a name="110343">

Alternately, style 1.2, employs a ``guard question'' that reduces the
difficulty of interpreting a response where the precondition does not
hold. It also increases the length of the interaction, though it may
be relevant for only a fraction of the cases encountered. In those
cases, guard questions may reduce the chance of communication
breakdown. In the context of a large number of yes/no questions,
however, style 1.2 could become tedious for users. <p>

</a>

<a name="108260">

<h3> Questions Eliciting Compound Answers</h3>

</a>

<a name="108287">

Figure 2 shows different styles of structuring questions to elicit
compound, or multi-part, answers. Style 2.1 offers the fewest
constraints as to how the user may answer and, if successful, is the
quickest and most efficient. The lack of expressed constraints on the
form of the expected reply may not be too damaging where a standard
way of specifying the information is already well-established in the
minds of most users. Style 2.2 breaks the question down into an
explanatory sentence and several prompts, a pattern that style 2.3
takes one step further. The extreme of this approach would be to ask
for each digit of the number separately, clearly an arduous task
especially considering the costs of turn-taking. It is, however,
likely to be the style having the highest recognition accuracy. <p>

<P><HR>

<pre>
Style 2.1:	S: What is your home phone number 
		U: 503...um... 690...

Style 2.2:	S: We need to know your home phone number.
		S: What is the area code?
		U: 503
		S: and the number?
		U: &lt;tel number&gt;

Style 2.3:	S: We need to know your home phone number.
		S: What is the area code?
		U: 503
		S: and the exchange?
		U: 226
		S: and...

Style 2.4:	S: We need to know your home phone number.
		S: Please state the area code &lt;pause&gt; 3-digit exchange, and 4-digit...
		U: 503    226   2...

Style 2.5:	S: We need to know your home phone number.
		Please state your number, area code first.
		U: 503
		S: Mmm-hmm
		U: 690
		S: Yes.
		U: 1121
		S: 1121. Ok.
</pre>
<h3> Figure 2: Questions eliciting compound answers</h3>
</a>

<p><hr><P>

</a>

<a name="108802">

Style 2.4, like style 2.3, specifies each component the user is
expected to provide, sharing with style 2.3 the danger of confusing
people unfamiliar with the notion of a telephone ``exchange'' or, more
generally, the names of the individual components. Style 2.4
encourages the user, however, to supply all components within a single
turn at speech. The need to forestall extended repair sub-dialogues
may require that the system offer acceptances [4] of users' utterances
after the components of multi-part answers are received. Style 2.5
depicts such a case in which the system provides feedback in the form
of acknowledgments and echoing [2,10].<p>

</a>

<a name="106505">

<h3> Questions Involving Choice Between Two Options</h3>

</a>

<a name="106526">

The heuristic depicted in Figure 3 describes the different ways of
asking questions where only two responses are expected (for example
``Are you male or female?''). Style 3.1 invites uncooperative users to
answer ``Yes'' or ``No'', especially if minimal or non-intuitive
intonation is used in presenting the question. This may require a
clarifying repair sub-dialogue perhaps employing a style-3.2 type
interaction. <p>

<P><HR>
<pre>
Style 3.1:	S: A or B?
		U: B

Style 3.2:	S: A?
		U: No.
		S: B?
		U: Yes.

Style 3.3:	S: A?
		U: No.
		S: Then B, correct?
		U: Yes/No.
</pre>
<h3> Figure 3: Questions involving choice between two options</h3>
</a>

<p><hr><P>


</a>

<a name="108223">

Style 3.2 increases the number of interactions required in the average
case, subsequently increasing the survey time overall. Further, if the
two options are truly mutually exclusive, users, recognizing the
overall intent of the series of questions, and volunteer the answer to
the underlying question (e.g., U: ``No, I'm a B.''), or worse (U: ``If
I said I wasn't female, then what else could I be but male?''). In
both cases the variety and complexity of expressions that must be
recognized are greatly increased.<p>

</a>

<a name="106531">

<h3> Questions Involving Choice Among Three to Six Options</h3>

</a>

<a name="110224">

Figure 4 depicts a heuristic for multiple choice questions having more
than two but still only a few alternatives. We judge that among the
different treatments, style 4.1 is somewhat less natural than styles
4.2 and 4.3. This is especially true for questions having
stereotypical answers (E.g. ``What's your marital status?''
``Single''). It is slightly less natural than Style 4.2, because a
human operator can compensate for the user's not mentioning an option
name directly and can either interpret a response as indicating a
category, or can move toward a Style 4.3 interaction if necessary.
While style 4.1 may be expected to elicit more constrained responses,
it may suggest that the user cannot be trusted to recognize the
choices, an indication that may appear to be insulting or
condescending if obvious choices are spelled out.<p>

<P><HR><P>
<pre>
Style 4.1:	S: &lt;ask question, give options&gt;
		U: &lt;option-name&gt;

Style 4.2:	S: &lt;ask question without giving options&gt;
		U: &lt;option-name&gt;

Style 4.3:	&lt;transform question into series of sub-questions
		(a decision tree) having yes/no answers&gt;

Style 4.4: 	&lt;for each option, ask if it is the case&gt;

Style 4.5: 	Similar to style 3, except when number of options
		is reduced to 2-3, ask for the option-name
</pre>

<h3> Figure 4: Questions involving choice among three to six options</h3>
<HR><P>

</a>

<a name="110246">

Style 4.2 constrains the response the least (e.g., S: ``What is your
current marital status?'') and would therefore be presumed to elicit
answers having greater variability (U: ``I've been living with X
for...''), again tending to reduce recognition accuracy.<p>

</a>

<a name="106556">

Style 4.4 takes the longest to achieve but does employ only yes/no
questions, as does style 4.3. Both invite the user to anticipate the
line of reasoning implied by the sequence and to volunteer the
response that the sequence of questions suggests, increasing
variability and reducing recognition accuracy.<p>

</a>

<a name="106557">

Style 4.5 may be a good compromise between styles 4.1 and 4.3,
allowing recognition of only a few keywords at any one time, without
the rigidity of a strict binary tree style.<p>

</a>

<a name="111266">

<h3> Questions Involving Choice Among More Than Six Options</h3>

</a>

<a name="106561">

The analysis here is similar to that for styles presented in the
previous section except that with more choices the problems become
more severe. Use of style 4.1 for more than six options may put a
severe strain on the user's short- term memory, while style 4.2 may
leave the user even more adrift as to what exactly constitutes a
proper answer. The decision tree of style 4.3 becomes deeper, though
not so quickly as the option-checking sequence of style 4.4, which
becomes clearly unnatural as the number of options increases.<p>

</a>

<a name="106572">

Figure 5 shows two more styles that may be useful in cases where there
are a large number of options. Style 5.1 is quite similar to style
4.5, with 5.1's ``other'' serving to help control the flow of the
dialogue. In style 5.1 and 5.2, recognition of the word ``other'' must
already be in place. Using style 5.1, the overall gains in automation
may be reduced by requiring human interpretation.<p>

<P><HR>
<pre>
Style 5.1:	&lt;reduce problem to fewer options and include
		``other'', then use more choice-constrained
		heuristics, in the case of ``other'', either store
		what the user says for later interpretation, or ask
		the same question with the next group of options&gt;

Style 5.2:	S: &lt;ask question, give explanation of n-at-a-time
		style, loop through the options n at a time&gt;

		U:  &lt;option name, or special phrases for user
		initiated repair&gt;

Figure 6 shows three different styles for eliciting brief, concise
answers.Of these, style 6.1 is quick and formal, though not
particularly ``friendly,'' and is likely to evoke a reasonably
focussed response. Style 6.2 takes longer but is likely to elicit
fewer open-ended responses. It is also likely to be frustrating for
expert users. Style 6.3 is most natural in presentation but does
little to constrain the response. Style 6.3 might require increasing
the coverage of grammar to accommodate more verbose or non-standard
responses, thereby decreasing recognition accuracy<p>

<P><HR>
<pre>
Style 6.1: 	Give ``telegraphic'' questions. For example,

		question. for example,

It is difficult, using current speech recognition methods, to
accurately gauge when a user has finished his or her turn at speech.
Moreover, it is difficult to provide timely feedback to the user as to
whose turn it is. We have identified at least three possible
implementations of turn-taking. If the system employs ``natural''
intonation patterns to signal end-of-turn, it may encourage users to
encode information in intonation, possibly causing misunderstanding.
If it relies only on illocutionary expectations, the dialogue may be
vulnerable to communication breakdowns following turn confusion. If it
uses beeps or other tone patterns to indicate turn completion, it may
require some explanation to the user, increasing the number of
utterances made by the system.<p>

</a>

<a name="112010">

For questions that require prior explanations, there are two general
styles: 1) provide as short an explanation as possible, or 2) provide
longer explanations. Longer or more frequent explanatory text
describing the intent of the question or the form of the expected
answer tends to increase the output time and the output vocabulary.
Increasing the output vocabulary may serve to entrain users into
believing the system is able to recognize a large vocabulary, leading
them to use out-of-vocabulary keywords or complex grammatical
constructs.<p>

</a>

<a name="106646">

In the case of the system's voice (either recorded human or computer
synthesized), we expect to find that users react negatively to the use
of synthesized speech. Not only is such technology not ``natural,''
but often difficult for human hearers to understand. We expect,
however, that users provide more concise answers when prompted by a
synthesized voice. In the course of developing the census system, this
heuristic was tested [11] with mixed results.<p>

</a>

<a name="106647">

Related to system voice is the choice of the persona within which the
system interacts [9]. Although we make no clear prediction as to the
effects of varying the persona on speech recognition accuracy, the
choice of persona may affect users' acceptance of the system.
Different personas in our case included the government, a census
taker, or a spokesperson. In the census project, the system persona
was an anonymous census enumerator.<p>

</a>

<a name="106648">

An area not explicitly tested in the census project was to vary the
rate of speech of the system voice. On one hand, we predict that
faster speech may be more compelling but entrains users to use faster
speech in response, possibly degrading speech recognition accuracy. A
slower rate of speech, on the other hand, may increase user
frustration and lead to users interrupting (or ``barging in on'') the
system voice, again degrading recognition accuracy. <p>

</a>

<a name="106649">

Finally, as the census project was concerned primarily with asking
questions, we did not develop extensive heuristics addressing how best
to convey information to, or answer questions of, the users. Where the
objective is primarily to convey information to the user, the quickest
style for presenting information would be simply to present it and go
on to the next stage of the dialogue. If it were critical that the
information be understood, the system might ask for confirmation and
go on if confirmed. Alternately, if the system detected silence or
sounds indicating that the user was uncertain or did not understand,
it could present the information again or inquire as to possible
sources of misunderstandings.<p>

</a>

<a name="106679">

<h2> Dimensions of Prompts</h2>

</a>

<a name="106681">

Although the heuristics described above were useful in the initial
stages of our project, they still did not capture what we term the
dimensions of spoken prompts. By examining the ways in which styles
varied within a single heuristic, we were able to identify different
``features'' that characterized the various styles. By examining
features used in different heuristics, we distinguished which features
were in opposition. These mutually exclusive features formed points
within a single dimension. <p>

</a>

<a name="106682">

The dimensions may be thought of as naming a way of varying a system
prompt. The dimension PreExplanation, for example, denotes the degree
to which the intent behind the prompt is described to the user before
the question is actually given. Although in this case, as in many of
the other dimensions, a whole continuum could be imagined, we often
limited our analysis to polar opposites (e.g. +PreExplanation and
-PreExplanation). In other cases, such as Decomposition, ordering the
points within the dimension was less clear.<p>

</a>

<a name="106683">

By revisiting the various styles for each of the heuristics, we
identified a set of dimensions characterizing the phrasing of system
prompts. These dimensions include the following ten:<p>

</a>

<ul>

<ul>

<a name="106684">

<li>PreExplanation. Should preparatory text be included before posing
the question(s)?

</a>

<a name="106685">

<li>Terse. Should the question be posed as tersely as possible?

</a>

<a name="106686">

<li>ListOptions. Should we list the set of words from which we expect
an answer?

</a>

<a name="106687">

<li>CompoundQuestion. Should we break the question down into its
component parts or leave it as one question?

</a>

<a name="106688">

<li>Polite. Should the question be phrased politely [9]?

</a>

<a name="106689">

<li>Decomposition.  Should we break down the selection from a list of
options into a decision tree, a partial decision tree, a decision
list, or not at all?

</a>

<a name="106690">

<li>AllowOther. Should we formulate the question so as to allow the
user to specify ``other'' as an option?

</a>

<a name="106691">

<li>Indirection. Should we ask the question indirectly (for example
``Could you spell that?) or should we require that questions be posed
directly, perhaps as commands (for example, ``Please spell that.'')?

</a>

<a name="106692">

<li>GiveOptionName. Should we mention the ``name'', or topic, of the
information desired (for example ``Are you married or single'' does
not mention ``marital status'')?

</a>

<a name="110711">

<li>GuardQuestion. Should we ask initial questions to rule out
incorrect presuppositions?

</a>

</ul>

</ul>

<a name="110700">

<p>

</a>

<a name="110719">

In addition, we also identified a number of dimensions characterizing
the interaction as a whole, including:<p>

</a>

<ul>

<ul>

<a name="111528">

<li>Voice (human or synthesized),

</a>

<a name="111529">

<li>Intonation (minimal or natural),

</a>

<a name="111530">

<li>Persona, and

</a>

<a name="111531">

<li>Turn-taking cues.

</a>

</ul>

</ul>

<a name="111532">

<p>

</a>

<a name="111533">

In total, these dimensions define a fourteen-dimensional space of
system prompts.<p>

</a>

<a name="106696">

<h2> Dialogue Styles</h2>

</a>

<a name="106698">

Having defined the dimensions of spoken prompts in terms of the
features of styles, we can now define more formally the concept of a
style as being a collection of points within a number of dimensions.
Since each style within a heuristic uses only a few of the identified
dimensions, a style can be described as a region in the space of
possible ways of expressing prompts. Figure 7 shows different styles
(described in terms of features) for eliciting the user's marital
status. Again, not all dimensions are explored equally. Instead, we
examine those regions in the space of system prompts that best suit
the needs of our dialogue evaluation effort. <p>

<P><HR><P>
<PRE>
Style 1:	(+Terse, -PreExplanation, -ListOptions)
		S: Marital status?

Style 2: 	(+Terse, -PreExplanation, +ListOptions)
		S: Marital status? Now married, widowed, divorced, separated, 
		or never married?

Style 3: 	(-Terse, -PreExplanation, +ListOptions)
		S: What is your marital status, now married, widowed,
		divorced, separated, or never married?

Style 4: 	(+PartialDecisionTree, -Terse, +GiveOptions, -PreExplanation)
		S: Are you now married (yes or no)?
		if no, then 
		S: Have you ever been married (yes or no)?
		if yes, then 
		S: Were you widowed, divorced or separated (please say one)?

Style 5: 	(+PreExplanation, +ListOptions, -Terse, +GiveOption)
		S: The next question will determine your marital
		status. The categories are: now married, widowed,
		divorced, separated, and never married.  What is your
		marital status?
</pre>

One of the advantages of using styles defined in terms of features is
that it allows us to characterize the overall style of the interaction
rather than limiting our analysis to identifying the style of a single
prompt. We thus define overall stylistic consistency of a SDS as the
property of a dialogue in which the styles associated with each prompt
do not conflict.<p>

</a>

<a name="106174">

<h2> EVALUATING DIALOGUE STYLES</h2>

</a>

<a name="107644">

In our development of the census dialogue model, we went through
several iterations of dialogue design, using up to four competing
designs in a test of which worked best. In order to converge quickly
on reasonable solutions, we started by identifying criteria that the
various dialogue models should meet. In particular, we considered
potential dialogues that were (a) closest to original form, (b) most
constrained, (c) most ``natural'', (d) clearest to the hearer, (e)
tersest, (f) most polite, (g) most open-ended, and (h) most
recognizable. By identifying the features that best met each
criterion, we were able to characterize the region in the space of
dialogue prompts best suiting our needs. <p>

</a>

<a name="111313">

The iterative approach required us to produce a method for assessing
the merit of each design as a basis for further refinement. We
addressed this problem from two perspectives: accuracy of recognition
and naturalness of interaction. To evaluate our dialogue designs we
used an objective measure of the conciseness of users' responses in
combination with a subjective measure of naturalness as reflected in
users' feedback to evaluation questions. Together these metrics
supplied grounds for making a wide range of dialogue design decisions,
including evaluating candidate styles. In addition, these evaluation
metrics provided a means to test the predictions made by our
heuristics. These predictions effectively narrowed the search space of
subsequent prompt refinements.<p>

</a>

<a name="112288">

We now briefly present a behavioral coding scheme, a subjective
evaluation metric, and some results from using our approach to
dialogue development for the census system.<p>

</a>

<a name="106180">

<h2> Behavioral Coding Scheme</h2>

</a>

<a name="106181">

The need to refine our system prompts so as to elicit only the most
concise and recognizable user responses led us to develop a behavioral
coding scheme (BCS) as an evaluation metric [11]. The BCS is used to
characterize a user's utterance into one of eleven classes. Each class
has an associated code which is used to label users' responses during
transcription. Table 1 provides a summary of the behavioral coding
scheme showing the eleven response classes, a brief description of
each, and an example system prompt and user response.<p>

The BCS can characterize a set of utterances; the distribution of BCS
codes associated with responses to a given question in different
treatments, or regions of the space of dialogue prompts, can be used
as a basis for evaluation. For example, suppose we have three
candidate prompt styles and wish to select the one that is the most
constraining. First, we collect data for the three prompt styles, then
label these data according to the BCS. Comparing the frequency of
class ``Adequate Answer 1'' for the three styles shows which style
elicited the most constrained responses.<p>

</a>

<a name="106184">

<h2> Subjective Evaluation Questions </h2>

</a>

<a name="106185">

Given the potential trade-off between recognition accuracy and
naturalness of interaction, reliance on the BCS as our sole criterion
when designing prompts might lead us to dialogues that were very
effective from the standpoint of eliciting highly recognizable
responses but rather awkward or frustrating for users. We balance the
behavioral coding evaluation of prompt styles with feedback from
users. We solicited this feedback through evaluation questions
presented at the end of the questionnaire providing users the
opportunity to express their likes and dislikes regarding any aspect
of the dialogue, including question topics, the wording of prompts,
and the manner in which the prompts were presented. <p>

</a>

<a name="112059">

<h2> Results of Evaluations</h2>

</a>

<a name="112139">

We used the behavioral coding scheme (and its predecessor versions),
task completion rates, and responses to evaluation questions in three
formal rounds of dialogue development in the Census project. The first
round (based on roughly 100 callers) involved comparisons of the
strongest differences among three overall styles. Our evaluation
enabled us to pursue only those designs that elicited constrained
answers and were generally acceptable to users.<p>

</a>

<a name="112152">

Subsequent rounds focused on increasingly smaller differences among
dialogue styles and thus required greater numbers of respondents. By
round three (involving nearly 4000 callers) the differences between
proposed dialogue designs were quite small and concise (AA1) responses
were elicited over 90 percent of the time for all census questions.<p>

</a>

<a name="106187">

<h2> DEPLOYMENT OF STYLES IN CSLURP TOOLKIT</h2>

</a>

<a name="106188">

The styles developed in the census project are proving useful in a
broad range of applications. As part of on-going research in SDSs we
have incorporated the notion of dialogue style into a toolkit [1] for
creating spoken-language applications. This toolkit provides
state-of-the-art speaker- and vocabulary-independent spoken-language
recognition technology allowing developers to design, test and deploy
spoken language interfaces rapidly for useful (real world)
applications. The toolkit greatly simplifies the process of specifying
a SDS by use of the Center for Spoken Language Understanding's rapid
prototyper (CSLUrp), a graphically-based SDS authoring environment.
CSLUrp currently provides a small set of style templates which a
developer may use to generate a prompt. A corresponding template is
displayed and slots in the template are filled with current vocabulary
items. <p>

</a>

<a name="110563">

If, for example, a dialogue designer were given the task of developing
an automated pizza-ordering system, and needed to generate a prompt to
elicit the size of pizza the user wanted, they would first specify the
vocabulary to be recognized (small, medium, or large). He or she would
then specify the style to be used in expressing the question (Polite1,
Polite2, or Terse). CSLUrp would then generate a prompt incorporating
both the vocabulary words and the style specification. Table 2 shows
the prompts generated in this case. After the prompt has been
generated, the designer is free to modify the text to better serve the
situation. Although its implementation of our framework is incomplete,
the repertoire of styles provided by CSLUrp has been used in the
development of a variety of SDSs, including e-mail browsers, ordering
and other form-filling systems, and even games.<p>

<h2> CONCLUSION</h2>

</a>

<a name="110038">

In this paper we have presented a set of heuristics describing
different styles of transforming a written questionnaire into a form
usable with a SDS. We have identified a set of features that
characterize these styles and a set of dimensions that cover and
contain the feature set. Taken together, the fourteen dimensions we
have presented define a space of system prompts. We refine the notion
of ``style'' as being a set of features characterizing a prompt.
Alternately, we define a prompt style as being a region in a space of
prompts.<p>

</a>

<a name="111457">

In order to evaluate the degree to which different prompt styles
constrain users' responses while maintaining a sense of natural
interaction, we have devised a behavioral coding scheme. Additionally,
we have sketched our initial efforts at incorporating prompt styles in
a rapid-prototyping toolkit. <p>

</a>

<a name="112662">

Scope for further integrating dimensions into the dialogue design
process, especially during prompt specification and dialogue
critiquing, offer promising areas for further research. It is our hope
that others will find this framework helpful, and we invite dialogue
designers to develop their own heuristics, features, dimensions, and
styles.<p>
