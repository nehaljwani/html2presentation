Widgets using different browsers</H1>

In this example we show the differences in appearance of the widget
set supported by HTML when viewed by different browsers.  It is
obvious from this that without substantial vendor and platform
customization it is not possible to get much control over the
appearance of the rendered document.  Note in particular that even
within the products of a single browser supplier (Netscape) the
widgets are vertically justified differently between the X and
Macintosh platforms. <P>
