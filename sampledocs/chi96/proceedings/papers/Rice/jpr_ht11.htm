The following are a number of different mockups for the ontology
editor shown in chronological order of their development.  Because
these are mockups, not all of the links point to anything meaningful.
For the sake of this demonstration, we have post-processed the mockups
so that all of the links should point either to another page of the
mockup or to <A HREF="jpr_ht63.htm"><B>this null page</B></A>.
If you click on <A HREF="jpr_ht63.htm"><B>this link</B></A>,
your browser should mark as visited all of the inoperative links.  All
other links should then point to some part of the mockup.
