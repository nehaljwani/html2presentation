This is an example of the way that the help page appears.  We get an
annotated explanation of the gadgets on the page and an explanation of
what each of the commands does.  The user reads the documentation and
decides that the <B>Create Subclass</B> command is appropriate.
Selecting this command from within the help page executes the command
as if it had been invoked on the original page....<br>

 something, and you use the back key, window history, or GO menu to go back
 in time.  This command will let you reload the page (if things have changed)
 without telling the browser to reload all of the images too.

<DT><INPUT VALUE="[Find Name]" TYPE="image" SRC="jpr_fg50.gif" NAME="UID-1355" BORDER="0"> (Find Name)<B>:</B>
<DD>Prompts you for a name to look for in all of the
    <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">ontologies</A>
    that are currently loaded into the ontology editor.
    Any name will match this search, whether it is the name of a
    <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">function</A>,
    <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">relation</A>,
    <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">instance</A>,
    <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">class</A>, or
    <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">axiom</A>.
    If there are multiple possible matches,
    a page showing these possibilities will be shown.  If there is only
    one possible match, you will be taken to the page showing that
    definition.<P>
    <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">
    Click here for a worked example</A>.  In any <B>Find</B> command you can enter a wildcarded pattern of things
to find.  Context-specific filtering occurs so that the only matches that
are found are those that are appropriate to the context.  Thus, if you are
finding a <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">class</A> name,
only existing class names will be found as matches.
Searches are case independent.  The <B>Find</B> facility is a superset of
what you already may be accustomed to in "completion" features in other
systems.
The pattern may contain:
<UL>
<LI>A sequence of alphabetics, which are required to match to the string
    in question.
<LI>A multi-character wildcard <B>*</B>, which will match to zero or more
    characters.
<LI>A single character wildcard <B>?</B>, which will match to exactly
    one character.
<LI>Escaped wildcard characters: <B>\*</B> or <B>\?</B>.
</UL>
There is no limit to the number of wildcard characters that can be supplied
in a pattern.  Searches all make initial substring matches, so you will
get "completion" behavior simply by typing in an initial substring.
<P>Some examples:
<DL>
<DT><B>Hello</B>
<DD>Will match to any word beginning with the string "HELLO"
<DT><B>*Hello</B>
<DD>Will match to any word containing the string "HELLO".  This is
    equivalent to <B>*Hello*</B>.
<DT><B>Hel?o</B>
<DD>Will match to any word beginning with the string "HEL", having any
    character after that and then having "O" after it.
</DL><P>
If the <B>Find</B> command finds more possibilities than the threshold
that you specified in your user preferences, ellipses ("...") will be
displayed and a new button labeled <B>Find All</B> will be displayed.
If you click on the <B>Find All</B> button, all possible matches will be
found and displayed, however many there may be.  If you click on the
ellipsis mark, the number of items displayed will grow by a number
specified by your user preferences.  If you click on a caret button,
the word following the caret will be inserted into the typein box.

  contents of the current page.

    <OPTION>EMail Class</SELECT> <B>:</B>
<DD>EMails the current <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">
   frame</A>.
   The address to which the frame is EMailed is determined by your user
   preferences.  The default will prompt you for an address.  You can also set
   your preferences so that definitions will always be mailed to you directly.
   See also the <B>Save [Frame] to File</B> command.  The definition that is
   mailed to you is not the page that you see, it is the Ontolingua source code
   definition of the frame.  This definition will conspicuously not include any
   references to inherited values,
   <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">slots</A> or
   <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">facets</A>.
<DT><INPUT VALUE="File" TYPE="submit" NAME="UID-1347">:<SELECT NAME="FILE">
    <OPTION>Save Class to group ...</SELECT> <B>:</B>
<DD>Saves the current <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">
  frame</A> to a file in the ontology editor's frame library.
  You can load such a saved frame with the <B>Load Definition</B> command.
  See also the <B>EMail [*]</B> command.  The file created by the save
  command will be authored (owned) by you and have the
  <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">group</A> ownership that
  you specify in the dialogue.
<DT><INPUT VALUE="File" TYPE="submit" NAME="UID-1348">:<SELECT NAME="FILE">

   You can load such a saved frame with the <B>Load Frame</B> command.
   See also the <B>EMail [Frame]</B> command.
<DT><INPUT VALUE="Create" TYPE="submit" NAME="UID-1388">:<SELECT NAME="CREATE">
    <OPTION>Slot</SELECT> <B>:</B>
<DD>Gives you a blank form in which you can create a new

   on the current
   <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">class</A>
   to add to the current
   <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">ontology</A>.
   You are prompted for the name of the new slot, its documentation string
   and its
   <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">domain</A> and
   <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">range</A>
   class(es).  The domain class defaults to the
   current class.  If you want simultaneously to define an inverse slot then
   you must supply a name for the inverse slot and its documentation in the
   appropriate boxes.<BR>
   Slots can be either Functions or Relations.  If you want the slot to be
   single-valued, i.e. a function, then you should click in the "Single
   Valued" checkbox.  The name for the new slot (and inverse slot)
   must be unique in the current ontology and its included ontologies.
   Supplying multiple domain classes will define a slot with a disjunctive
   domain.  Supplying multiple range classes will specify a disjunctive
   range.<BR>

<DT><INPUT VALUE="Create" TYPE="submit" NAME="UID-1389">:<SELECT NAME="CREATE">

   You are prompted for the name of the new instance, its documentation string
   and the classes of which the new instance is to be a direct instance
   (defaulting to the current class).  You can provide multiple classes
   separated by whitespace if you want the instance to be a direct instance
   of multiple classes.  The name for the new instance must be
   unique in the current ontology and its included ontologies.

   You are prompted for the name of the new class, its documentation string

   (defaulting to just the current class).  The name for the new class must
   be unique in the current ontology and its included ontologies.

  from the current

  References to this frame in other frames and axioms are

  interesting debugging hints that it can give you.  All
  <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">slots,</A>
  slot values,
  <A HREF="jpr_ht64.htm">facet</A>,

<DD>Gives you a dialogue that allows you to create
  a copy of the current

  The form prompts you for a name for the new frame and for the ontology
  into which it is to be put.  Only ontologies to which you have write access
  will be shown in the ontology menu.  It defaults to the current ontology.
  The name of the new frame must be different from any existing definition
  name within the ontologies included by the ontology into which the copy is
  to be placed.  Use the FIND button to make sure that the name is unique.
