<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>
Modern application software often includes operations that are performed by complex mathematical algorithms. These 
algorithms--far from being the &quot;black boxes&quot; typically portrayed in computer science courses--may instead be 
viewed as interactive processes, each presenting its own particular &quot;interface&quot; to the user. This paper, then, offers 
a number of <I>interface guidelines for mathematical algorithms</I>--principles whose purpose is to suggest ways in which 
users may employ algorithms with greater control and expressiveness. As a source of examples, we illustrate the guidelines 
through a particular complex mathematical problem--that of generating a &quot;folding net&quot; for a three-dimensional 
solid.

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
Implicit in almost every university catalog is a taxonomy of knowledge--the world is divided into discrete subjects such as 
physics, history, and (in most universities) computer science. These subjects themselves are likewise divided into 
subdisciplines, as reflected by the individual courses. Delving further, and exploring the offerings within computer science 
departments, one will usually find both an algorithms course and a human-computer interaction course. It is overwhelmingly 
likely that these two courses will be taught by different faculty, employ different teaching assistants, share no readings, and 
make use of little of the same language or technical background. Within computer science, algorithm design and human-
computer interaction are about as different as subdisciplines can be.

<P>

But in practice, mathematical algorithms do, after all, present something of an interface to their users--even if that interface is 
as simple as a request for parameters. And increasingly, as computer applications become more powerful and complex, they 
employ algorithms whose behavior is more varied, more unpredictable to the user. A paint program may, for instance, 
include something like a &quot;select region&quot; function whose behavior is defined as &quot;selecting all nearby pixels 
whose current color, when compared with the color of the selected pixel, is within some distance in an abstract color-
space.&quot; A mathematical algebra program may automatically regroup terms in polynomials, following some algorithm 
whose behavior it is left to the user to induce (and whose results may often leave the user perplexed). 
&quot;Intelligent&quot; help systems may construct models of users' backgrounds or intentions through algorithms whose 
details, or even outlines, remain mysterious.
<P>
This paper presents a number of broad design guidelines, or principles, for creating interfaces to mathematical algorithms--in 
effect, for bridging the &quot;thin glass line&quot; of the computer screen that separates the worlds of algorithm and 
interface design. The governing assumption in seeking these guidelines is that we would like to provide the user with flexible 
means both for controlling and understanding the algorithm in question. If we assume, in contrast, that users are incapable of 
understanding even the outlines of the algorithm--for instance, that our hypothetical paint program user would be unable to 
understand the notion of testing the distance of two colors in an abstract color space--then the issue is resolved before we 
begin, and we can at best present the user with a choice of typical parameters to our algorithm. In this argument, we assume 
that users will exhibit a high level of interest in and (potential) understanding of the algorithms that they employ in a 
professional context, and we seek means of providing users with effective and expressive control over those algorithms.

By way of presenting the suggested guidelines, this paper will use an illustrative algorithm for solving (if partially) an 
interesting and complex mathematical problem--namely, the problem of generating a two-dimensional &quot;folding 
net&quot; for a three-dimensional solid. The following section briefly describes this problem and its history, and shows a 
general algorithm for solving it in certain instances. In the third section we extend this basic algorithm with a variety of 
suggested improvements; these improvements are motivated by (and, in succession, illustrate) the principles for creating 
&quot;algorithm interfaces&quot;. The fourth section draws out the links between the principles as they appear in the context 
of this particular sample problem, and the same principles applied to other similarly complex mathematical algorithms that 
crop up within software applications; this section also describes the relation between this effort and other work, especially in 
the area of algorithm animation. The fifth section concludes with some directions for future research.

<H2>THE FOLDING NET PROBLEM</H2>
Consider the polyhedral solid shown in Figure 1a, and imagine that our goal is to create a paper model of this solid. One 
means of doing so would be first to find a two-dimensional &quot;net&quot; of the solid, as in Figure 1b, which we could 
print on paper; then we would cut around the outlines of this net, and fold along the edges to form the desired polyhedron. 
The notion of producing a folding net for a solid is credited (along with the term &quot;net&quot; for the pattern itself) to the 
16th-century artist Albrecht Durer, who devised the first such nets for the five Platonic (or regular) solids, among others. [12] 
(The solid shown in Figure 1 is, in fact, one of these regular solids--the dodecahedron.)
<P>

A &quot;folding net&quot; for the solid.<P>
In utilitarian terms, the generation of folding nets for  solid is potentially important: one could imagine uses for nets in (say) 
packaging, architectural modelling, or three-dimensional illustration. In purely mathematical terms, the problem of 
generating a folding net for a solid is complex, for a variety of reasons. First, it is unclear how we might determine whether a 
given solid even has a viable folding net (i.e., one in which the solid has been cut and &quot;unfolded&quot; along some of 
its edges to form a connected set of two-dimensional polygons, and in which the polygons don't overlap so that the net can 
be printed on a single sheet of paper). The net in Figure 1b is viable--none of the pentagons overlap, the solid has been sliced 
along its edges, and the entire two-dimensional shape folds back into a dodecahedron; but in fact there are some nonconvex 
solids for which no such net exists. The question of whether every convex polyhedron has some folding net (allowing 
&quot;cuts&quot; of any kind) is an open problem in computational geometry [4]; and to my knowledge, no one has 
demonstrated a &quot;bad&quot; convex polyhedron for which a viable folding net (allowing only cuts along edges) cannot 
be produced.
<P>
In short, then, we do not know, when given a polyhedron, whether a net can be found (though for convex polyhedra, we 
might at least be hopeful of obtaining one). There is also a flip side to this issue: a particular solid may admit of several (or 
perhaps many) nets. Figure 2, for example, shows two other distinct nets (besides that in Figure 1b) for the dodecahedron. 
The problem of finding a folding net for a solid is thus difficult in two opposing senses: we are not sure if there is any 
solution, and--having found some solution--we cannot be sure that we have found (for our purposes) the best possible 
solution.
<P>

<P>
Algorithms for dealing with problems of this &quot;uncertain&quot; kind generally fall under the heading of heuristic or 
approximate search. (NP-complete problems, such as the famous &quot;travelling salesman&quot; problem, are typically 
approached this way as well [3]). We look to find some realistic solution with an eye not toward guaranteeing the best 
solution, but to &quot;satisficing&quot; (in Simon's [16] term): essentially, getting a livable solution without spending 
inordinate amounts of time and effort trying to obtain a slightly better solution.
<P>
Here, then, is the broad outline of an algorithm that can often manage to solve the folding net problem (though it is by no 
means guaranteed to do so). This algorithm will be our starting point for the explorations of the following section.
<P>
<B><I>Algorithm 1</I></B><P>
For unfolding a polyhedron P-3D with faces {F-3D} to produce a planar net N with faces {F-2D}:
<P>
(1) Begin by choosing a face F from {F-3D}. On the 2D plane, place a polygon f congruent to F. This single polygon now 
constitutes the net in progress.
<P>

{2} If there are no more unaccounted-for faces in {F-3D}--that is, if there are no more faces whose equivalents have not been 
placed in the net N--then we are done. Return the net N.
<P>
{3} Otherwise, choose a face f within the net corresponding to a face F in {F-3D}, and see if F shares an edge with an 
unaccounted-for face F' in {F-3D}. Place a 2D face congruent to F' in the net so that it shares an edge with the appropriate net 
polygon congruent to F, along the corresponding shared edge. Check whether the newly-placed net polygon overlaps any 
other polygon currently in the net. If there is no overlap, go back to step {2}.
<P>
{4} If there is an overlap, look to see whether F shares an edge with some other unaccounted-for face F''. If so, go back to 
step {3} (using F'' in the role of the face F'). If not, go back to step {3}, attempting an alternative choice for the face f. If 
there are no remaining choices for the face f in step {3}--i.e., if we have unsuccessfully tried every available face in the net as 
the face from which to &quot;expand&quot; the net--then announce failure.
<P>

Figure 3 illustrates several successive &quot;snapshots&quot; of this algorithm at work in the case of the regular octahedron. 
Here, the algorithm begins by placing one of the triangular faces of the octahedron on the 2D plane; it then 
&quot;grows&quot; the net incrementally by finding polygons in the net that border unaccounted-for faces on the solid, and 
adding those faces to the two-dimensional net. The final result, once all eight faces are accounted for, is shown at the end of 
the second row in Figure 3.
<P>

<H2>PRINCIPLES OF &quot;ALGORITHM INTERFACE 
DESIGN&quot;: THE FOLDING NET PROBLEM 
REVISITED</H2>
Algorithm 1, as presented in the previous section, is a workable (though far from ideal) solution to the problem of generating 
folding nets. One could certainly imagine incorporating this algorithm into a larger application--indeed, something like this 
algorithm is included in a  polyhedral-modelling system developed in our laboratory, &quot;HyperGami&quot; [8], in which 
the user designs three-dimensional solids on the screen and is then able to create decorated folding nets for those solids.

<P>

In principle, then, we could simply present the user with a button or menu choice of the form &quot;Generate Net for 
Current Solid&quot;; when the user selects this choice, Algorithm 1 will be run. Such a plan is problematic, however, for 
two reasons:
<P>
(a) Algorithm 1, as written, simply makes one single attempt to generate a net. That attempt may fail; whereas, if the 
algorithm were to be re-run under slightly different conditions (e.g., choosing a different starting face F in step 1), the 
algorithm may succeed. Thus, if the algorithm fails, the user should not be left utterly without options until she is satisfied 
that no solution (or at least no easily obtained solution) exists.
<P>
(b) Even if the algorithm succeeds, it may find a net that the user would prefer to avoid. Consider, for instance, the problem 
of generating a net for an octagonal pyramid, as shown in Figure 4a (this is a loose approximation to a cone). Running 
Algorithm 1 on this solid may well produce the net shown in Figure 4b. While this is a perfectly reasonable folding net from 
the mathematical standpoint, it is a poor choice from the human standpoint: the process of actually cutting and folding the 
net in Figure 4b would require folding eight separate triangles toward a single point, and gluing the edges of those triangles 
together (an extremely tedious and error-prone chore). 
<P>

<I>Figure 4b (right)</I>. A technically correct, but manually problematic, net for the pyramid.
<P>

It is worth taking a moment to reflect on the issues described in (b) above. Over and over, what at first blush appears to be a 
purely mathematical problem--finding a net, arranging terms of a polynomial, presenting steps in a proof, finding a path for a 
robot through a maze of obstacles--turns out to include highly contextualized, difficult-to-formalize aspects. We wish to 
express a polynomial, <I>calling attention </I>to the higher-order terms in one particular variable; we wish to present steps 
in a proof so that coherent <I>patterns of reasoning </I>are visible (i.e., the steps should not be placed in a technically valid 
but incoherent order); we want a path for the robot that not only achieves the goal but does so while providing the visual 
appearance of <I>purposeful behavior</I>; or, in our present case, we wish to find a folding net that does not presume 
inordinate manual skill.
<P>
In any event, the issues raised in (a) and (b) suggest that we would like to provide the user with some sense of how our 
algorithm ran in some particular case--i.e., where it may have gone astray; and moreover, we would like to provide the user 
with means for rerunning the algorithm with alternative choices of running parameters. This can be summarized in the first 
two design principles for algorithm interaction:
<P>
<I>Principle 1.</I><BR>
When creating an interface to some algorithm, allow for a version that permits the user to observe the algorithm's effects as 
it runs. 
<P>
<I>Principle 2.</I><BR>
Create means that allow the user to learn and understand the effect of altering constant parameters within the algorithm, and 
to perform those alterations.
<P>
Realizing Principle 1 in the case of the present algorithm is relatively straightforward--if we do not interpret the principle too 
strictly. We can simply allow the algorithm to run in normal fashion, placing its various choices of net polygons on the 
plane as it obtains them (as opposed to simply working in silence and either announcing &quot;failure&quot; or producing a 
fully-blown net at the end of the process). Thus, the algorithm would produce, as it runs, a sequence of visible nets like those 
shown in Figure 3 earlier.
<P>
Conceivably, Principle 1 could be employed more creatively than this. We might, for instance, need to allow the user to 
slow down or &quot;tune&quot; the running speed of the algorithm so as to observe its effects; running the algorithm at its 
maximal speed may prove counterproductive if it hinders understanding. We might also augment the algorithm with a variety 
of visual cues to indicate the path taken; in our present case, for instance, the most-recently-placed polygon in the net could 
be shown in red. Going a bit further, we might present the user with both a three-dimensional rendering of the solid being 
unfolded, and a two-dimensional rendering of the net-in-progress; and the most-recently-placed net polygon could be shown in 
the same color as its corresponding three-dimensional face. 
<P>
An extreme version of this idea might entail elaborating the algorithm with more and more visual information, all with the 
intent of illustrating the operation of the algorithm. Where possible, such additional information should appear unobtrusive 
within the working context of the algorithm--that is, the visual information should not render the overall application a purely 
pedagogical exercise. (We will return to this issue in a later section.)
<P>
Principle 2 appears rather straightforward at first--presumably, the user should be able to specify important parameters to any 
complex algorithm. Thus, in the present case, the user should be able to select (for instance) the 3-dimensional polyhedral 
face from which the net-generation process will begin in Step 1 of the algorithm.
<P>
There are subtle problems encountered, however, in trying to interpret Principle 2 more creatively. A &quot;parameter&quot; 
to an algorithm such as Algorithm 1 above may not be quite as straightforward as a number or polygon. Consider, for 
instance, the third step: it involves choosing a &quot;frontier&quot; polygon in the net, and finding an edge of that polygon 
corresponding to a 3d (solid) edge bordering a still-unaccounted-for face. The choice rules for both these operations may 
themselves be parameters to the algorithm: for instance, we might wish to specify that the algorithm will always choose the 
most recently-placed polygon in the net as the &quot;frontier&quot; from which to attempt expanding the net (in effect, 
performing a depth-first search). Specifying a choice rule--as opposed to a simple value such as a number--as input to an 
algorithm touches upon the often controversial notion of end-user programming [5, 7, 13, 14]: conceivably, the user should 
be given something like a programming language with which to express &quot;choice rules&quot; in complex algorithms. 
A less contentious position in this situation would be that the user should have, at the very least, a set of discrete 
&quot;typical&quot; choice rules from which to select, or (somewhat more powerful) an algorithm-specific 
&quot;grammar&quot;--perhaps less extensive than a complete programming language--with which to express notions such 
as choice rules.
<P>
Considering the notion of a &quot;choice rule&quot; as an algorithm parameter leads to yet another principle, regarding when 
such a choice rule is most effectively considered by the user. The standard assumption for algorithm design is that parameters 
are dictated as initial fixed inputs to the algorithm, which is then run to completion. But in the case of a procedure such as 
Algorithm 1, we may have a better sense of what parameters to choose once the algorithm has actually begun operation: for 
instance, we may have a more informed notion of what would constitute a good choice rule at the moment that the choice 
rule needs to be employed. Moreover, we might well want this type of repeatedly-employed parameter to be dictated 
dynamically, more than once in the course of the running algorithm (as opposed to being dictated in static and irrevocable 
fashion at the outset).

<I>Figure 5b. </I>The net after several more steps, using a rule in which each new polygon is attached to the most recently-
placed available polygon.
<P>
To take a specific example: suppose, once more, that we are generating a net for an octagonal pyramid. The algorithm might 
begin by placing the solid's base octagon as the first face in the two-dimensional net, and then  a neighboring triangle 
corresponding to one of the &quot;side&quot; faces of the pyramid. (See Figure 5a for illustration.) The algorithm might 
then--and only then--pause for the user's input as to choice rule for next polygon in the net to expand. In this case, the user 
might select as choice rule &quot;most recently-placed net polygon&quot;, so that the algorithm attempts to attach the next 
net polygon to an edge of the triangle (as opposed to an edge of the octagon). The net produced after several more such steps 
is shown in Figure 5b. At this juncture, the user might interrupt the algorithm once more to re-define the choice rule, 
indicating that (e.g.) future new polygons should be joined (if possible) to those polygons with few vertices that were placed 
earlier. The algorithm would then continue by placing its next triangle on the bottom edge of the earliest-placed triangle (the 
one in Figure 5a).
<P>
The rationale behind a scenario of this kind is based upon the notion of &quot;reflection-in-action&quot; described by Schoen 
[15] and eloquently advocated in the realm of user interfaces by Fischer and his colleagues [10]. These writers present a 
portrait of design activity in which decisions are often made not in the manner of <I>a priori </I>specifications, but rather in 
a more dynamic fashion, as the need for the decision arises. Such notions can be applied to interaction with algorithms just 
as they can with the sorts of design domains considered by Schoen.  (This extension of an &quot;improvisatory&quot; style 
of work to computational media also resonates strongly with the ideas expressed by Dourish [6] in designing systems that 
present dynamic &quot;accounts&quot;, or self-generated representations, of system behavior.) In any event, we can 
summarize by stating our third principle of algorithm interaction:
<P>
<I>Principle 3.</I><BR>
There should be means for permitting users to specify parameters to the algorithm at the time they are employed; and for 
those parameters that are employed repeatedly, there should be means of treating those parameters as &quot;fluid&quot; by 
altering them in mid-process.
<P>
This principle leads, in turn, to a fourth which implements the notion of at least a single level &quot;undo&quot;: if we 
have chosen a particular fluid parameter and run into trouble as a result, we should be able to return to the state of the 
algorithm at the moment of the last (apparently flawed) decision--a form of user-directed &quot;backtracking.&quot;
<P>
<I>Principle 4.</I><BR>
For those parameter choices that have been dynamically specified midway, there should be means for storing the state of the 
algorithm at the time of the most recent specification and returning to that state in order to revisit the user's previous 
decision.
<P>
To return to the (somewhat artificially simple) example of the octagonal-base pyramid: suppose that after two polygons in 
the net have been placed (as in Figure 5a), we specify that the rule for choosing the next polygon to expand will be to select 
the least-recently-placed polygon. After a second triangle has been placed (in Figure 6a), we realize that our choice is going to 
produce a problematic net, so we should be able to interrupt the algorithm and return it to the state in which we made the 
previous decision. From this point, we choose an alternative next-polygon rule and resume the algorithm, generating (after a 
second triangle has been placed) the net shown in Figure 6b.

<I>Figure 6a (top)</I>. The net for the pyramid in Figure 4a, after three polygons have been placed.<BR>
<I>Figure 6b (bottom)</I>. A more promising start for the  net.
<P>
&quot;Undo&quot; facilities of the type suggested by Principle 4 are  a staple of user interface design courses, but in practice 
they typically apply to discrete actions taken via direct manipulation by the user, not to parameter choices for running 
algorithms.
<P>

Finally, even when a complex algorithm has run to successful completion, users (being only human, after all) may still be 
dissatisfied. For instance, even if our algorithm has produced a successful folding net, we may still sense a possibility for 
improvement after the fact. In this instance, an algorithm should provide means for <I>post hoc 
</I>&quot;adjustment&quot; of its solution to a particular problem.
<P>
Consider, as an example, the folding net shown in Figure 7a. In this case, the user has produced a perfectly reasonable net for 
a truncated prism--but she would still like to tinker. She could now be presented with a &quot;post-algorithm&quot; 
operation allowing her both to select an &quot;end polygon&quot; in the net (a polygon with only one net-connected edge) 
and to observe which other edges in the net could be attached to that same polygon. Using this operation she should now be 
able to repeatedly shift end polygons to other available positions, as illustrated for one such shift in Figure 7b.
<P>
Our fifth principle for interacting with algorithms, then, is:
<P>
<I>Principle 5.</I><BR>
Algorithms should not run to an irretrievable conclusion, but should wherever possible be accompanied by &quot;post-
algorithmic&quot; operations that allow the user to modify (if only slightly, in accordance with &quot;legal&quot; moves) 
the solution produced by the algorithm.

<H2>THE &quot;ALGORITHM INTERFACE 
PRINCIPLES&quot; IN OTHER CONTEXTS</H2>
To this point, the principles described in the previous section have all been illustrated through one (conceivably artificial) 
problem--that of generating a folding net for a solid. To suggest the ways in which such principles might be employed in 
other contexts, this section presents an extended scenario in which &quot;conventional&quot; application behavior might be 
profitably perturbed to accommodate the principles.
<P>
Suppose, then, that the user of a hypothetical paint program selects a starting point on some picture; his intent is that this 
will be the point from which he would like to select a region of contiguous pixels within the picture, all within a given 
&quot;RGB color distance&quot; <I>d </I>of the starting point. Instead of selecting this color distance via some abstract 
symbol (such as &quot;high/medium/low distance&quot;), or through some unexplained numeric value, the algorithm 
presents the user with a representation of the RGB &quot;color cube&quot; (cf. the representation in [11]) and allows him to 
select the desired parameter by drawing a sphere of radius <I>d </I>around the color of the starting point. (Principle 2: the 
algorithm presents its parameters in a manner faithful to their use and meaning within the process itself.) Once invoked, the 
algorithm, rather than simply presenting a final boundary to this region &quot;by magic&quot;, instead may be slowed down 
to portray the way in which the boundary of the region is incrementally obtained. (Principle 1: the algorithm slows down to 
indicate its mode of operation to the user.) 
<P>
Over time, the user becomes sufficiently familiar with this algorithm that he is able to use a more advanced version in 
which, as the region around the starting point is incrementally searched (at moderate to slow speed, so that the search process 
is visible), the color distance used as the effective search &quot;filter&quot; may be altered: that is, rather than merely 
produce a region whose RGB-distance from the starting pixel is less than <I>d </I>throughout, the user may 
&quot;tune&quot; or vary the parameter <I>d </I>as he observes the region grow on the screen. (Principle 3: a parameter 
used repeatedly in the course of the running algorithm may be made &quot;fluid&quot; in practice.) The overall region thus 
generated may reflect multiple choices of the distance <I>d</I>: e.g., the region might use a &quot;loose&quot; distance 
filter over some portions of the boundary, a &quot;strict&quot; color filter over other portions. In employing this more 
complex version of the &quot;region selection&quot; routine, the user is also able to &quot;back up&quot; the search 
process to the point where the last change in the parameter <I>d </I>was made (Principle 4.) Overall, the boundaries of the 
regions generated in this &quot;tunable&quot; search process may be much more complex than those generated in a simpler, 
&quot;fixed-parameter&quot; version.
<P>
Finally, once a region has been generated, the user is able to revisit the region boundary (perhaps &quot;zooming in&quot; 
on those portions), selectively moving small portions of the boundary outward or inward. (Principle 5: Once the algorithm is 
run, its results may be modified by related &quot;post-algorithmic&quot; operations.)
<P>

It may be argued at this juncture that the principles articulated for &quot;algorithm interaction&quot; are hardly anything 
new: after all, when selecting an operation within some application, we would <I>always </I>wish to choose a parameter for 
that operation in an informative way (Principle 2),  to see the operation itself performed in instructive fashion (Principle 1),  
to have the option to undo some recent set of decisions (Principle 4), and so forth. This is true: but in practice, applications 
tend to treat the invocation of algorithms as atomic actions, employing algorithms in the &quot;black box&quot; fashion 
more typical of presentations in computer science courses. Algorithms tend to be written to run at maximum speed rather 
than with maximum transparency, and as a consequence, users are left with (at best) a very coarse-grained picture of how 
many popular operations are actually performed: region fills, spline creation, digital image warping, text justification all 
remain mysterious. Of course, for many users the &quot;black box&quot; assumption is perfectly reasonable--the majority of 
us may not be especially interested in how the standard &quot;fill&quot; operation is actually performed in most paint 
programs, and may be satisfied to employ a black-box version of the algorithm to run at maximal speed. But the option 
either of understanding or interacting with such an algorithm is rarely offered. The purpose of presenting these principles as 
means of interacting with algorithms is merely to suggest that in many cases, algorithms may themselves be thought of as 
the subjects of interface construction.

It should also be mentioned that there are definite commonalities of interest between the principles suggested here and many 
of the techniques used for algorithm animation [1, 2, 17]. Most efforts at algorithm animation, however, focus on presenting 
algorithms strictly for pedagogical purposes: i.e., the user's presumed intent (at least in the short term) is to understand but 
not actually employ the algorithm. Moreover, algorithm animations typically present processes at a level somewhat 
abstracted from use within applications: we may see an animation of a depth-first search routine, but not the use of that 
routine in the course of generating (say) a folding net for a solid. The argument of this paper, in contrast, is to weave at least 
some of the ideas associated with algorithm animation into the actual working contexts of applications themselves.

<H2>ALGORITHM INTERFACES: SOME 
DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH</H2>
The previous section concluded with a distinction drawn between the &quot;practical&quot; context suggested for the 
principles described here, and the &quot;pedagogical&quot; context assumed for most algorithm animation efforts. Merely 
because the interface principles suggested here are intended for integration within working algorithms, however, does not 
imply that they have no pedagogical value. In fact, it may well be that users who learn about (say) depth-first search in the 
course of ongoing, and personally meaningful, professional work will have more motivation to experiment with the 
algorithm than those who learn of the algorithm in the rather abstract setting of a computer science course (even if that 
course is augmented by beautifully prepared animations). Again, this echoes the sentiments of Fischer [9], who argues for 
effective learning in the context of ongoing work (the basis for what he has dubbed &quot;learning on demand&quot;).
<P>
It would be of particular interest, then, to incorporate (some of) these principles within selected complex algorithms in 
professional applications, and to study the pedagogical effectiveness of the principles in that context. Such an effort might, if 
the results are encouraging, lead professional application designers to incorporate more &quot;transparent&quot; algorithms 
into their systems. While this might appear to be a utopian wish in an era when algorithms are treated as proprietary 
information, designing applications with transparent algorithms might actually prove of financial benefit if it lends greater 
expressiveness (and hence satisfaction) to an application's user community. And placing transparent algorithms within 
applications might serve the purpose of enlisting the culture of professional application design, easily and unobtrusively, in 
the larger task of computer science education.
<P>
Moreover--returning to the academic theme with which we began--thinking of algorithms as interactive (rather than purely 
and majestically deterministic) processes might lend an interesting twist to the study of algorithms themselves. Currently, it 
is rare to see algorithms analyzed in any terms other than those of computational requirements in space or time. Nonetheless, 
an algorithm which, in practice, lends itself to expressive interaction might be far superior than one that runs faster but offers 
no avenues for creativity to its users. As suggested earlier, it would appear that especially difficult problems--including, one 
might guess, many NP-complete problems--are good candidates for the design of interactive algorithms. Rather than run a 
non-interactive algorithm for (say) a variant of the &quot;travelling salesman&quot; problem, one might enlist the 
occasional aid of the user--particularly if (as so often happens), the user is aware of relevant context-specific information for 
this particular instance of the problem. Pursuing this direction might lead us to analyze the performance of algorithms as 
augmented by human interaction: we might find, in practice, that an algorithm rich in its interactive capabilities actually 
outperforms (in the quality of its solutions) a more time-efficient &quot;black box&quot; algorithm. This type of study 
might lead us in turn to analyze algorithms, on occasion, in terms of the interactions that they afford, rather than the 
resources that they require. And eventually--perhaps--our university courses in human-computer interaction and algorithm 
design might actually share the occasional reading.
