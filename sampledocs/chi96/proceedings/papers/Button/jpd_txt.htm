<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>

The design of CSCW systems has often had its roots in
ethnomethodological understandings of work and investigations of
working settings. Increasingly, we are also seeing these ideas applied
to critique and inform HCI design more generally. However, the attempt
to design from the basis of ethnomethodology is fraught with
methodological dangers.  In particular, ethnomethodology's overriding
concern with the detail of practice poses some serious problems when
attempts are made to design around such understandings. In this paper,
we discuss the range and application of ethnomethodological
investigations of technology in working settings, describe how
ethnomethodologically-affiliated work has approached system design and
discuss ways that ethnomethodology can move from design critique to
design practice: the advent of <I>technomethodology</I>.

<H2>ETHNOMETHODOLOGY AND DESIGN</H2>

There has been much discussion within the HCI community about a &quotturn
to the social&quot (e.g. [23], [38]). Particularly within CSCW, but also
within HCI, many of those who are considering such a move have been
attracted to ethnomethodology [18] as a favoured sociological
position. Ethnomethodology turns away from the structures and
theorising of traditional sociology, concentrating instead on the
details of the practices through which action and interaction are
accomplished. In this respect, designers have found ethnomethodology a
richer resource for insights about the organisation of work than
other, more theoretically oriented, sociological positions.

<P>
More or less ethnomethodologically-oriented investigations are now
regularly presented at CSCW conferences (e.g. [1], [5], [7], [8],
[30], [37], [39]) and increasingly at HCI conferences, ([6], [13],
[26]). Ethnomethodology is being used to inform design through:

<OL>
<LI>fieldwork investigations that develop an understanding 
of work and organisations from the &quotinside&quot, providing 
innovative insights into the organisational situatedness 
of work and the methods and practices through which 
work activities and interactions are assembled and 
which may be used in the design of technology to support work; and

<LI>developing an understanding of the temporal organisation of
activities and interactions, revealing them to be a moment-by-moment
organisation, and in so doing furnishing new concepts around which to
generally consider the design of technology.
</OL>

<P>
There are a number of inter-related reasons why some 
within the design community are taking up these two sets of 
issues.

<P>
First, Lucy Suchman's book &quotPlans and Situated Actions&quot [43], which
articulated an argument that has significantly influenced many
designers, was partly founded in the work of ethnomethodology. Her
analysis emphasised a perspective on purposeful human action as
situated in (and organised around) the context of particular
circumstances, and, in doing so, provided a forceful critique of the
user modelling and plan-based approaches common in both HCI and AI.
Suchman's book has had considerable influence upon HCI research and
design, becoming almost an icon of a concern in HCI with work settings
and the detail of everyday working practices; and, as relevant parts
of the design community have taken on board Suchman's arguments they
have also taken on, perhaps unwittingly, an ethnomethodological
influence.

<P>
Second, there has been a strong and vocal group within HCI who have
consistently argued that the requirements for technology should be
developed around the work situations of users, most particularly in
the Participatory Design movement (e.g. [22]). Ethnomethodology is
generally concerned with the &quotdetailed and observable practices which
make up the incarnate production of ordinary social facts&quot [35] which
means that its studies of work domains contain rich descriptions of
work practices. This may suggest to those who are already concerned
with the relationship between work and design that they have an
analytic ally who may be readily turned to as a resource to draw upon
either for methodological sustenance or even empirical descriptions.

<P>
Third, for a variety of reasons that we will not go into here,
ethnography as a method of enquiry has been attracting a great deal of
attention from some within CSCW and HCI, (see e.g. [2], [31]). Like
some other positions within sociology, ethnomethodology uses
ethnographically generated material in its studies, though the
analyses that it develops from these can vary significantly from those
produced by other types of sociology. It is often difficult for those
in the design community to apprehend the difference between competing
sociological arguments, and the relevance for so doing might even be
questionable. Ethnomethodology may, as a consequence, be basking in
the sun of ethnography in general, some in design equating an interest
in ethnography with an interest in ethnomethodology.

<P>
Fourth, Grudin [23] has argued that HCI has passed through a number of
stages and is currently moving from the fourth stage which focused
upon a dialogue with the user to a fifth stage of focusing the
interface not around the individual but the work
setting. Ethnomethodology may thus be, for some, a port in the storm
of transition, for ethnomethodologists' emphasis upon not only work
practice but also upon the organisational situatedness of work may
offer candidate solutions to problems of incorporating the work
settings, as well as work practice, into design.

<P>
However, the experience has been that the attempt to incorporate
ethnomethodological understandings into design--either specific
artifacts, or the design process in general--has been problematic. The
models, assumptions, processes and sensitivities of the various groups
involved have been sufficiently different as to present problems for
their integration. This paper, indeed, follows in a tradition of
introspection and analysis on the integration of our disciplines, and
the respective roles played by each (e.g. [31], [41]), and this
reflection mirrors similar issues in the integration of other
theoretical approaches to the human sciences into HCI design
(e.g. [3]). In this paper we want to unpack the issues surrounding the
application of ethnomethodological accounts of working situations,
and, critically, of ethnomethodology itself, not only to situations
which involve technology, but to the design and introduction of
advanced technologies. Our goal is primarily to understand and develop
the relationship between ethnomethodology and technological design;
secondarily, we hope that this might address some issues in the
relationship of the human sciences to HCI practice more widely.

<P>
Having reviewed the basis for the current interest in ethnomethodology
within HCI, we will next examine the contributions that have so far
been made for technological support for socially-organised activity
which have come from an ethnomethodological perspective--what we'll
call &quottechnomethodology&quot.

<H2>ASPECTS OF TECHNOMETHODOLOGY</H2>

Ethnomethodologically affiliated studies have been conducted across a
wide range of work situations that involve technology: the work of air
traffic controllers [25], city stockbrokers [30], software engineers
[12], designers [36], print shop workers [8], municipal transport
controllers [27], as well as the users of menu-driven computer systems
[29], multimedia technologies [28] and photocopiers [43].

<P>
These studies fall into two related areas of enquiry: investigations
of the organisation of social action and interaction; and
investigations of the organisation of work and work settings.

<H3>The Organisation of Social Action and Interaction</H3>

One direction of research has been into the ways in which people
organise and manage everyday social activity. In particular,
Conversation Analysis, a branch of ethnomethodology, has developed an
extensive corpus of findings about the ways in which people generally
build up their social actions and interactions with one another and
more recently, a conversation analytic sensibility has been
extensively used in studies of the ways in which people interact with
one another through or around technology. An obvious contender for
such scrutiny are technologies that provide for access between persons
who are geographically distributed, and attention has been paid to
video-mediated communication, (e.g. [28]). The thrust of this work is
to furnish descriptions of the ways in which persons normally organise
their actions and interactions and then compare this to what is
possible or not possible using the technology. However, it is not just
video-mediated communication that has been the subject of such
examinations but also other work settings in which technology is used,
such as control suites [27]; the doctor's consulting room [21], and
stock dealing rooms [30].

<H3>The Organisation of Work</H3>

A second major thrust in the work of ethnomethodology has been the
examination of the practices and methods through which people
accomplish their work. In particular, it has been concerned with how
it is organised in such a way as to make it recognisable to others as
uniquely the work it is.  Ethnomethodologically affiliated studies of
work have been made of technologically rich work settings. Suchman
has, over a number of studies (e.g. [45]), developed descriptions of
the practices through which particular types of work-settings are
organised as centres of co-ordination. A team of researchers at
Lancaster University in the UK have, again over the course of a number
of studies (e.g. [25]), developed detailed descriptions of the work of
air-traffic controllers.  There has also been a series of studies of
the work of engineers (e.g. [42]). In addition to these examples of
sustained enquires into domains of work there have been numerous
one-off studies of work and the role of technology. These mainly
involved studies of the organisation of the work prior to the
introduction of technology and the subsequent effects that the
technology had, e.g. Button and Harper's [11] examination of the
introduction of an accountancy package into the furniture industry and
Bowers, Button and Sharrock's [8] description of the impact of a
Management Information System on the work practices involved in the
organisation of a flow of work on the shop-floor in the print
industry.

<H3>Ethnomethodological Critiques of Technology</H3>

We have been describing two main themes in ethnomethodological work,
the organisation of social action and interaction and the organisation
of work, and how these have been applied by those who claim an
ethnomethodological affiliation to the study of social action,
interaction and work involving technology. Taken together,
ethnomethodologically affiliated studies have produced a strong
critique of the design of technology at work for they have displayed
that technology, at best, often fails to support the work it is
designed for, or at worst, does not allow people to actually engage in
their work, because the technology is not aligned to the practices
through which they organise their actions, interactions and
work. Heath et al summarise this conclusion for CSCW in the following:
&quotDespite impressive technological developments in CSCW, it is widely
recognised that there are relatively few examples of successful
applications in real world settings. [...] it is suggested that the
lack of success of CSCW systems derives not so much from their
technological limitations, but more from their insensitivity to the
organisation of work and communication in real work environments&quot
[30].

<P>
We will content ourselves with two examples to make this point. First,
based in part upon Conversation Analysis and the work of its founder
Harvey Sacks, Lucy Suchman [44] has challenged speech act theory upon
which systems such as Winograd and Flores' &quotTHE COORDINATOR&quot are
based.  The thrust of her criticism in this respect is that
conversation analysis has demonstrated that meaning and intention are
interactionally contingent, something that is not accounted for in
speech act theory. Consequently, this is a feature of ordinary action
and interaction which cannot be supported by THE COORDINATOR, indeed a
feature of social action and interaction that is violated in the
stipulative organisation imposed by the system.

<P>
Second, Bowers, Button and Sharrock [8] examined the work of printers
on the shop-floor and described how, in being faced with the
uncertainties of orders which could result in either periods of high
demand which stretched operators and machinery or in periods of low
demand when operators and machinery were idle, operators would use ad
hoc practices not found in the formal representation of the work-flow
of the print room, to &quoteven out&quot the flow of work.  However, when a
technology designed to organise the flow of work on the shop-floor was
introduced, it utilised a formal model of work flow which prevented
the operators from utilising their ad hoc practices. The result was
that the printing work was seriously disrupted with order deadlines
being missed and significant over-time having to be done. Quite
simply, the technology was not designed with knowledge of the methods
and practices through which the work it was designed to organise was
done, the methods and practices being revealed through
ethnomethodological study.

<H3>Critique and Design--Two Paradoxes</H3>

As we have seen, then, ethnomethodological analyses have been used in
a range of circumstances to critique technological design in
particular working settings and situations.  Ethnomethodology, in
attending in particular to the details of everyday action and work
practice, has been able to expose an unfortunate paradox in the design
of technologies for collaborative activity (or socially-constructed
action).  This is the <I>paradox of system design</I>--that
the introduction of technology designed to support
&quotlarge-scale&quot activities while fundamentally transforming the
&quotsmall-scale&quot detail of action can systematically undermine
exactly the detailed features of working practice through which the
&quotlarge-scale&quot activity is, in fact, accomplished. It points,
fundamentally, to the interdependence of minute practice and grand
accomplishment.

<P>
However, in so doing, ethnomethodology finds itself caught in a second
paradox--the <I>paradox of technomethodology</I>. (Taken togehter,
these paradoxes produce what Grudin and Grinter [24] have called the
&quotethnographers' dilemma&quot.) Given the concern with the
particular, with detail, and with the moment-by-moment organisation of
action, how can ethnomethodology be applied to the design of new
technologies? Certainly, ethnomethodologists have urged that designers
take into account the methods and practices through which social
action, interaction and categories of work are organised; but in the
face of the unavoidably transformational nature of technology and
system design in working settings, it would seem that ethnomethodology
becomes relatively powerless. Its tradition is in analysing practice,
rather than &quotinventing the future&quot. Even Heath and Luff's observations
of the relative impotence of gaze and gesture in video-mediated
communication are, to an extent, undermined by accounts of the active
transformation of visual conduct in video-mediated interaction by
which the same communicative <I>accomplishments</I> are reconstructed;
reconstructed, ironically enough, out of the <I>lived detail</I> of video
interaction [17].

<P>
Ethnomethodologists interested in technology and design have thus so
far, and after much effort, managed to make the first step from the
study of the use of technology to the critique of technology. The next
step however is yet to be taken and will be more problematic which is
to move from critique to design. How can design now productively learn
from ethnomethodology?

<H2>LEARNING FROM ETHNOMETHODOLOGY</H2>

We have outlined two related forms of &quottechnomethodological&quot
enquiry. Operating across these, however, are fundamental issues about
how to incorporate findings and insights from ethnomethodology into
the process of design. This integration is at the heart of
technomethodology, and raises some of the most important questions for
both ethnomethodologists and designers. To explore the issues, we set
out three ways in which this relationship can operate.  Two caveats
should be noted. First, actual practice will tend to draw, to some
extent, on elements of each; but a pedagogical separation helps frame
the discussion. Second, for the CHI audience, we present these largely
in terms of design learning from the ethnomethodological perspective;
in practice, of course, the relationship is bidirectional.

<H3>Learning from the Ethnomethodologist</H3>

Arguably, to date, the most widespread and successful approach to
incorporating ethnomethodological input into the design process is for
the design process and designers to learn from the
ethnomethodologist. In this model, the ethnomethodologist goes into
the field to study a work setting.  While the results may be written
up as an ethnomethodological account of the work, it is not this
account, but rather the ethnomethodologist, who will be the primary
resource for the design process. Fresh from the field, brimming with
detailed observations and an analytical framework within which to
organise them, the ethnomethodologist works closely with the designers
from the earliest points in the process. From the designers'
perspective, the ethnomethodologist serves as a proxy for the users in
the field--or, perhaps more accurately, a proxy for the <I>field setting</I>
itself.  Design ideas can be &quotbounced off&quot the ethnomethodologist, who
draws on field observations both to evaluate and to contribute to
aspects of the design.

<P>
Where is the locus of the ethnomethodology, in this model?  Primarily,
it is in the ethnomethodologist's head. From the perspective of the
designers, the ethnomethodologist is almost indistinguishable from any
other fieldworker, and ethnomethodology, itself, is not crucial as
input. Ethnomethodologists will presumably use their analytical
perspective in shaping a story about the field setting, and in
evaluating and contributing to the design. However, it is primarily
the ethnomethodologist--as a trained field worker--who acts as a
channel between the designers and the users.

<H3>Learning from Ethnomethodological Accounts</H3>

A second approach is to organise the design around <I>specifically</I>
ethnomethodological analysis. In particular, the second approach
involves <I>learning from ethnomethodological accounts of work
settings</I>. Like the first approach, this will probably involve the
close collaboration of ethnomethodologist and designer; however, the
primary difference is that the designer is working with a specifically
ethnomethodological analysis of the work situation, rather than with
an ethnomethodologist who might use his training and judgement to
respond to design specifics.

<P>
The locus of ethnomethodology is in the account--and that's a key
distinction, because now it is an explicit part of the communication
between field and design. In many ways, this is a much more
satisfactory way to proceed; one which proceeds from an understanding
that ethnomethodology is an analytical perspective, a form of &quotwriting
up&quot rather than a form of data collection [2]. However, it's harder to
do, and it's certainly less common. The first approach, after all,
does not require the designers to be sufficiently well-versed in
ethnomethodology to be able to read an ethnomethodologist's account of
a working situation.  What's more, the first approach more directly
reflects the feeling that design must &quotengage the user&quot; the feeling
which has lead to the emergence of User-Centred Design as a movement,
and to the increasing use of ethnographic field techniques in design
in the first place! Connection between designers and users is valued
and sought out, so the &quotdisconnection&quot implied by mediation through an
ethnomethodological analysis rather than through a person is,
consequently, to be avoided. However, the second approach more
adequately builds on ethnomethodological understanding (rather than
simply any field observation); and so, if we are to take seriously a
turn towards ethnomethodology in particular, then we must similarly
understand how this second approach proceeds.

<H3>Learning from Ethnomethodology</H3>

In the first approach, design was organised directly around the
contribution or involvement of an ethnomethodologist.  In the second
approach, it was organised around an ethnomethodological analysis of a
working situation; a more explicit basis in ethnomethodological
investigation, rather than simply on field observation and
commentary. The third approach is to make the connection at a deeper
level yet.  Here, the design process <I>learns from ethnomethodology</I>.
That is, we consider the implications which foundational
ethnomethodological principles--those insights and perspectives which
characterise the discipline--hold for both the artifacts and processes
of design. In this approach, design does not take on board
ethnomethodological analysis and insights, but takes on board the very
study policy of ethnomethodology.

<P>
This approach differs significantly from the first two, in that it
regards the relationship between ethnomethodology and system design as
a theoretical matter. Again, this theoretical orientation is why we
have been concentrating on ethnomethodology, rather than qualitative
methods in general.  So, rather than have systems design and
ethnomethodology &quotreach&quot towards each other and &quotmeet&quot at a design, we
instead look to forge more foundational relationships, and then
approach design from this new position. This foundational relationship
is one in which design adopts the analytic mentality of
ethnomethodology, and ethnomethodology dons the practical mantle of
design. We look forward, through this approach, to what Garfinkel has
often referred to as the emergence of a &quothybrid&quot discipline from out
of ethnomethodological studies of other disciplines.

<P>
This approach is as radical for ethnomethodology as it is for system
design. On the one hand, it deals directly with the generally
operative social processes which are the currency of ethnomethodology;
elements such as situatedness, practical action and representation,
achievement and mechanism, phenomena of order, and accountability. On
the other hand, it deals with the fundamental, almost implicit,
aspects of system design--generalisation and abstraction,
configuration, data and process, fixedness and mutability. So rather
than ask, &quotwhat are the implications of this ethnomethodological
account of the work of hotel receptionists for the design of a booking
system?&quot, we might ask, &quotwhat are the implications of the operation
and use of member categorisations for questions of individuality and
grouping in software systems?&quot. This is a quite different order of
question.

<P>
To make this more concrete, let's consider a specific example. In
recent work, we have been concerned with issues of abstraction and
representation in system design. In particular, we have looked at the
contrast between, on one hand, the traditional role of abstraction in
systems design and, on the other, the practical aspects of
representations of activity from an ethnomethodological
perspective. From this we have developed of a notion of &quotaccounts&quot
[16]; computational representations which systems continuously offer
of their own behaviour and activity, as a resource for improvised and
contextualised action. Accounts draw on recent research on software
architectures and &quotopen implementations&quot [33], which introduce the
idea of a &quotcausal connection&quot which maintains the correspondence
between representations and the systems they represent. In the
accounts model, this causal connection provides for the continual
<I>accountability</I> of the account; the backing in its relationship
to the action of the system which lends it legitimacy. Just as
ethnomethodology has shown how social activity is accountable,
i.e. performed in such a way as to reveal its organisation, so our
notion of computational accountability relates interface activity to
the structure of what lies below. Interface activity is organised
within an account of the system's action, so that it can become a
resource for the ongoing management of user activity and interaction.

<P>
The notion of accounts and accountability as a basis for
system-building constitutes a significant reorientation of abstraction
in system design. Computational abstractions provide modularity and
separation. The abstraction &quotstands for&quot the behaviour of the code
which implements it.  Abstraction barriers are opaque; on the one
hand, they hide the complexity of what lies behind, and on the other,
they present it for use in some rationalised way. So system design
traffics in abstractions, rather than in meanings, interpretations or
behaviours.

<P>
Accounts begin to capture some of the flavour of the social.  This
alternative view is less concerned with what the abstraction (or
representation) is, in itself, focusing instead on what it can do and
how it can be made to work. They place the emphasis on where the
abstraction came from, how and why it was produced, by whom and for
whom. The representation exists only by dint of its being maintained
and supported, being made acceptable to the parties on either side for
some set of purposes and actions. So when we begin to design systems
with a model of &quotabstractions as accounts&quot, the action isn't in the
abstraction, but in how the abstraction can be <I>worked</I>--in the notions
of accountability which make it useful.

<P>
Accounts illustrate the investigation of an aspect of system design
with respect to an aspect of ethnomethodology as a body of
knowledge. As such, they exemplify our third approach to system
learning--from ethnomethodology itself, rather than from particular
ethnomethodological investigations, or from the ethnomethodologist as
a proxy of the working situation. The success of the first two
approaches in the development of CSCW systems and technologies is
testament to their value; however, the deeper connection between
ethnomethodology and system design as disciplines, seems crucial to
the progression from study and critique to design.

<H2>HUMAN SCIENCES AND DESIGN PRACTICE</H2>

The general problem which we have addressed here--on the relationship
between a body of disciplinary knowledge and the practice of HCI or
CSCW design--is hardly a new one to the HCI community. Over the past
ten years or so, many analyses have focused on the relationship
between a range of scientific understandings and HCI design (see, for
example, [3], [34]); a range of design approaches drawing on different
levels of theoretical input have been developed and explored
(e.g. [14], [15], [32]); and attempts have been made to integrate
multiple theoretical and practical approaches to HCI design (e.g. [4],
[9]).

<P>
In many ways, some of the distinctions which we have presented in this
paper--especially our separation between the three modes of
incorporation of ethnomethodological understandings into design
efforts--mirror these analyses of (primarily) cognitive science and
human factors knowledge into the HCI design process. In much the same
way as we describe designers learning from ethnomethodologists as
work-setting proxies, so human factors specialists have been
introduced into design teams. Similarly, by analogy with our second
form of collaboration, attempts have been made to inform system design
on the basis of cognitive models of human activity. And finally, our
third approach can be thought as being related to more radical
attempts to restructure the design process around a cognitive &quotscience
base&quot. Even in particular, restricted areas of research investigation,
we can see these various approaches operating at once--consider, for
example, the range of ways in which research on mental models has been
incorporated, more or less directly, into the design of interactive
systems.

<P>
In this way, then, our concerns here relate to a larger set of
concerns within the HCI community. As such, we hope that our
perspective can also shed light on those general issues.  However,
there are a number of aspects of our position which differ from these
approaches in significant ways, some of them based on the nature of
the particular theoretical perspective, ethnomethodology, which
concerns us. We will address three here.

<P>
The first reason to explore these issues was discussed in the first
section of this paper--the prevalence of ethnomethodological
perspectives in the design of collaborative systems.  Collaborative
systems open up new sets of issues for theoretical exploration, and we
have increasingly found those issues work their way back to more
traditional areas of HCI.  So, just as the various approaches to the
incorporation of cognitive and psychological approaches to HCI design
reflect the particular details of the various approaches--indeed,
different approaches appear to be most fruitfully applied in different
ways and at different points in the process--so a focus on
ethnomethodology, simply as a new discipline, opens up these issues to
further scrutiny.

<P>
The second important point to be made is that the third level of
connection between ethnomethodology and system design which we have
advocated, and described with the example of the &quotaccounts&quot work, is
<I>not</I> a link between theory and practice; it's a link between theory and
theory. An important understanding which underpins our attempt to
identify fruitful relationships of this sort is that it is not simply
enough to consider the implications which a theoretical
orientation has for the way in which we design systems; rather, it is
critical that we consider the implications for the <I>nature of the
systems we design</I>. A respectfulness for the notion of improvised
action, or for the social production and use of representations,
forces a reorientation of perspective which reaches deeper than the
design process itself.

<P>
The third issue has to do with the very nature of ethnomethodological
understandings; and in particular, with ethnomethodology's overriding
attentiveness to the detail of practice. Ethnomethodology itself set
out to respecify issues arising from the application of models,
theories and structures in traditional sociology, and hence
ethnomethodology's position on the relationship between practice and
generalisation is itself a slippery one, forcing us to look in new
ways at how to incorporate ethnomethodological understandings in
system design. So this relationship between the abstract and the
particular is the crux of any relationship we might try to derive
between ethnomethodology and design.

<H2>ABSTRACTION AND PARTICULARITY</H2>

<QUOTE>
&quot... the reported phenomena are only inspectably the 
case. They are unavailable to the arts of designing and 
interpreting definitions, metaphors, models, constructions, types or
ideals. They cannot be recovered by
attempts, no matter how thoughtful, to specify an examinable practice
by detailing a generality.&quot
-Harold Garfinkel [19]
</QUOTE>

<P>
The roots of ethnomethodology--and, in particular, its radical
respecification of the issues of sociological analysis--are firmly
grounded in a primary concern with the particulars of everyday,
practical action. System design, on the other hand, is fundamentally
about the creation, manipulation and use of abstractions. So, as
ethnomethodology has encountered systems design, it has sometimes,
perhaps unfairly, been seen as exclusively concerned with detail and
specifics--the &quotexcruciatingly particular&quot--and unwilling, or unable,
to trade in generalisations.

<P>
However, this is a short-sighted criticism. It is important to note
that many of the social &quotmechanisms&quot that ethnomethodology has
described are found across many different social circumstances. For
example, Garfinkel and Sacks [20] describe &quotcohort independence&quot
phenomena, by which they mean social phenomena that are not tied to
the scenic features of their production. Thus, for example, the model
for turn-taking in conversation [40] is, in some crucial respects,
cohort independent in that it operates across local circumstances such
as gender, ethnicity, race, occupational identity, etc. It is these
sorts of generally operative social processes, explicated by
ethnomethodology, which we turn to in our third approach to
technomethodology. These processes are, in Sacks et al's terms,
&quotcontext free, yet context sensitive&quot.

<P>
Since we are advocating the use in design of general processes arising
from a discipline concerned with the particular, there are some issues
to be clarified. We will make two points here.

<P>
The first is to emphasise that the generally operative social
processes to which we make appeal are incontrovertibly grounded in
practice. They arise from, and are employed in, the specifics of
everyday action. Their generality does not lie in any &quotabstracting
away&quot of detail; it lies, instead, in their general
<I>operativeness</I>, the wide range of actions and interactions which
they underpin.

<P>
The second observation is that ethnomethodologists and system
designers will typically put the generalisations of their disciplines
to work in very different ways. On one hand, the ethnomethodologist's
generalisations tend to be <I>analytic</I>
characterisations--categories and descriptions of action employed to
delineate, describe and explicate action.
On the other hand, the abstractions of software engineering
are <I>generative</I>; they not only characterise system action but,
themselves, give rise to it. Abstractions in computer programs produce
behaviour; indeed, all behaviour is generated through some set of
abstractions (embodied in software systems, programming languages and
instruction sets). As a result, ethnomethodologists and system
designers have, traditionally, had very different ideas of the scope,
form, nature and use of generalisations.

<P>
Understanding the place of abstraction and generalisation in
ethnomethodological accounts of work is critical to making the move
between the three forms of learning, because it represents a move
towards the abstract. In particular, the move represents an attempt to
work with a set of <I>sensibilities</I> rather than with the details of
specific activity, even though, of course, those sensibilities arise
out of the discipline's very concern with the grounded and specific
experience of everyday activity. In other words, the third approach to
technomethodology attempts to align system design not so much with the
details of <I>specific working practices</I>, as with the details of the
<I>means by which such working practices arise and are constituted</I>.

<P>
This distinction is critical to the successful interworking of systems
design and ethnomethodology, as is the recognition--and, subsequently,
the <I>working</I>--of the difference in models of abstraction.

<P>
Consider an example to illustrate this distinction. In recent years,
there has been an interest in utilising the insights of
ethnomethodology for the development of dialogical
interfaces. Attempts have been made to build in the <I>specifics</I>
of Sacks et al's turn-taking model, such as the rules associated with
speaker transfer, into computer interfaces. However, our argument is
that the value of the turn-taking model described by Sacks et al is in
the way it which it shows how the abstractions of conversational flow
are <I>sustained</I>, rather than rote procedures by which they might
be <I>enacted</I> [10]. It is this notion of the ongoing management of
conversation, rather than the specifics of any human dialogue, which
provides an abstraction for design. When we fail to make the
distinction, we fall foul of the paradox of technomethodology.

<P>
So, the two paradoxes which we described--the paradox of system
design, and, particularly, the paradox of technomethodology--are based
in large part in the differing forms and uses of generalisation in the
two disciplines. The third approach of technomethodology--one which
attempts to work with generally operative processes from
ethnomethodology as resources for design--is a starting-point in
attempting to resolve some of these difficulties.

<H2>SUMMARY</H2>

The design of both single-user and multi-user interactive systems on
the basis of ethnomethodological studies of working settings and work
practice has been relatively successful, but nonetheless
problematic. The force and tellingness of these accounts of work is
testament to their utility, but aspects of ethnomethodology's project
pose problems for design practice. The paradox of technomethodology
lies in the attempt to design novel technological solutions based on
an analytical perspective with a specific orientation towards the
existing detail of practical action. We have discussed three
approaches to working with ethnomethodology in system design; and in
particular, we have proposed a model which applies not simply to the
process of design but, crucially, to the nature of computational
artifacts in working settings. Our intention is to identify ways in
which ethnomethodology and system design can be combined in ways which
are respectful of both as bodies of knowledge and practice; and, in so
doing, we have pointed in particular to fundamental differences in the
nature and use of generalisations and abstractions in the two
disciplines. Our ongoing project is the investigation and exploitation
of precisely these relationships in the pursuit of technological
support for everyday activity and working practice.
