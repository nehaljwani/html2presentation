<I>The Unanimous Declaration of the Network Integration Software
System Architects</I>
</Center>
<P>
When in the course of human events, it becomes necessary to establish
a new direction for product usability, it is imperative to state
the foundation for the new approach.
<P>
For Network Integration Software, we hold these truths to be self-evident,
that
<UL>
<LI><I>Communities</I> of people are a fundamental structure of
working. 
<LI>The innate diversity in communities and environments results
in heterogeneous, distributed computing solutions.
<LI>Change is a natural part of those communities and environments.

<LI>Community productivity and cost of ownership are primary purchase
criteria.
<LI>Usability of software, both within and across components,
is a critical market success factor. 
<LI>Usability depends on designing from a common set of system
assumptions. 
<LI>A highly usable product set is easy for people to learn and
remember, it is efficient and satisfying to use, and few errors
occur. People fulfill their intentions in a way that feels integrated,
graceful, enjoyable, and
aesthetically pleasing. 
</UL>

<P>
We, therefore, the Usability Architecture Team and the System
Architects, representing the Network Integration Software development
organizations of Digital Equipment Corporation, do solemnly publish
and declare that <I>all</I> future products we develop will treat
usability as a critical system attribute and will strive to:
<UL>
<LI>Integrate people's tasks and intentions, not underlying technology.

<LI>Preserve a person's unique identity, regardless of the location
from which they enter the network, the technology they use, the
communities to which they belong, and the tasks they perform.
Allow people to perform any task called for by their role in their
organization.
<LI>Treat a group as a single entity, independent of its changing
members, their locations, and the
technologies they use. Enhance the effectiveness of these communities
of people by making group membership automatically provide all
the shared resources and capabilities of the group.
<LI>Enable people to view, organize, use, and manage the rich
distributed environment without having to know about its underlying
technology or location. 
<LI>Make the distributed system robust in an ever-changing environment.
Reveal changes in the distributed environment only when those
changes are relevant to people's ability to achieve their desired
goals. 
<LI>Build user interfaces that are consistent in appearance and
behavior with people's expectations, industry standards, and other
Network Integration Software products.
</UL>

<P>
And for the support of this Declaration, we mutually pledge to
each other our work, our fortunes, and our honor.
<P>
