<h2>
<a name="RTFToC1">ABSTRACT</a></h2>
In physical presence, you are most aware of your immediate surroundings, such
as what is at your feet or who is beside you, and less aware of objects further
away. In telepresence, almost the opposite is true. Due to the nature of the
medium, you are most aware of what is in front, often at a distance, as
dictated by the limited view of the camera. Even where remote camera control is
possible, the range of exploration is limited and the logistics of control are
typically awkward and slow. All of this adds up to a pronounced loss of
awareness of the periphery in telepresence.<p>
The research described here attempts to compensate for these problems through
two mechanisms. First, we provide telepresence users with two separate views,
one wide-angle and the other, a controllable, detailed view. To simplify
navigation, the two views are seamlessly linked together, so that selecting a
region of one will have an effect in the other. Second, we utilize sensor
information from the remote location to provide the user with notification of
relevant events that may require attention. Together, these tools significantly
enhance users' awareness of their telepresence surroundings.

<a name="RTFToC3">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
Normal human vision can be conceived as consisting of two highly mobile cones
of view. One is the focused foveal cone, one degree wide, while the second is
the peripheral cone, or global field of view, spanning approximately 170
degrees [1]. Excellent spatial resolution is provided by the first, while the
second, lower resolution view, provides us with stimulus that acts to redirect
our attention. <p>
Camera-monitor mediated vision, in contrast, suffers in resolution and due to
the size of the display, uses limited azimuth of the visual field. Watching
television, for instance, typically involves the foveal cone only. The narrow
channel of information, both in the sense of bandwidth and field of view,
imposes limitations on the ability to explore, follow conversations, check
reactions, and generally sense significant actions in a remote space, such as
people passing by or entering. In such situations, users must choose between a
global and a focused view. With the former, resolution is sacrificed to permit
a wide field of view and easy change of gaze direction. If only the focused
view is provided, users obtain details but no peripheral awareness. This is
typical of most videoconference settings [5] [11]. <p>
One approach to support both the foveal and peripheral cones is with multiple
views. The problems with this approach are well understood. The Multiple Target
Video (MTV) system of Gaver et. al. [12] first proposed the use of multiple
cameras as a means of providing more flexible access to remote working
environments. Users were offered sequential access to several different views
of a remote space. However, as the authors noted, a static configuration of
cameras will never be suitable for all tasks. Furthermore, switching between
views introduces confusing spatial discontinuities. A further study (MTV II) by
Heath et. al. [15] attempted to address this latter issue by providing several
monitors, so that every camera view was simultaneously available. While this
new configuration was more flexible, the inability of static cameras to provide
complete access to a remote space still remained a problem. Furthermore, the
various views were independent of one another, and the relationship between
them was not made explicit. Consequently, spatial discontinuities
persisted.<p>
Another approach involved the Virtual Window concept [10], which uses the video
image of a person's head to navigate a motorized camera in a remote location.
Our user experience with this technique [7] revealed a significant improvement
to the user's sense of engagement in meetings. Unfortunately, when the camera
was focused on a small area, the loss of global context often made the user
unaware of important activity taking place out of view. <p>
To compensate for the limitations on vision imposed by camera-monitor mediated
telepresence, the work discussed here offers to:<p>
<ul>
<li>1. Provide both a global (peripheral) and a detail (focused) view,
simultaneously. We note that this approach has already been used extensively in
the Ontario Telepresence Project [2] [3] [17] by combining the two views
through a picture-in-picture device. The same approach with multiple views was
also proposed by Kuzuoka et. al. [16]. However, as will be discussed later,
providing a link between the two views is not only critical for usability, but
also supports the goal of multiple views while avoiding the pitfalls of spatial
discontinuities inherent in the MTV studies [12] [15].<p>
<li>2. Provide a navigation mechanism using these views, allowing users to redirect
their view in both direction and scale, through a simple user interface.<p></ul>
However, even with these two goals satisfied, the user is still sensorally
deprived to the extent that it may inhibit social interaction. Therefore, our
third goal is as follows:<p>
<ul><li>3. Provide a sensory surrogate or prosthesis to compensate for the limited
scope of visual information. </ul>
<h2>
<br>
<a name="RTFToC4">SUPPORTING FOVEAL AND PERIPHERAL CONES
</a></h2>
It has been suggested by several vision researchers that a brain mechanism
exists to drive foveating <a href="ky_fn1.htm">saccades<sup><i> 1</i></sup></a> of the
eye in response to stimulus in the periphery region [14] [19]. In the
discussion of their model of saccadic eye movement, Tsotsos et al. comment that
these saccades play an important role in the exploration of the visual world
[18]. Supporting evidence for this comes from neurophysiology. A region known
as PO, which receives a representation of the periphery of the visual field,
has been identified in the brains of primates [4]. Deprived of this
information, individuals suffering from tunnel vision, or a loss of vision
outside the fovea, exhibit severe problems navigating through their physical
surroundings, even when these surroundings are familiar to them [13]. With this
in mind, it becomes readily apparent that camera-monitor mediated telepresence
is bound to suffer unless peripheral vision can be supported concurrently with
a detailed, foveal view.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC5">Overlaid Multiple Views
</a></h3>
As an initial attempt to provide this support, we developed a prototype system,
consisting of a large and small display, as shown in Figure 1. The large screen
display provides the user with a wide angle view of the remote space while the
small display provides a high resolution view of the area of interest. With the
camera orientations fixed and the proper geometric positioning of the two
displays, spatial discontinuities are minimized. The sensation of increased
peripheral awareness obtained by this system is very powerful.<p>
We note that this prototype requires two high-resolution displays, one of them
quite large, in order to achieve a significant effect. As this may be
prohibitively expensive for most videoconference users, we would like to unify
the two views into a single display. Unfortunately, even with a large screen
display, the limited resolution would make the quality of the foveal region
unacceptable. Another approach is required.<p>
<center><IMG SRC="ky_fg1.gif" alt="Figure 1"></center><br>
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC6">Disjointed Multiple Views
</a></h3>
Another approach to supporting both the foveal and peripheral views is to
display the two separately on the same screen. Since the views are disjointed,
each can have sufficient size and resolution, even with the limitations of
current technology. Our implementation of this system is shown in Figure 2. The
top portion of the display provides a foveal or detail view, obtained from a
user-controlled motorized camera, while the lower portion provides the
peripheral or global view from a fixed, wide-angle camera.<p>
<center><IMG SRC="ky_fg2.gif" alt="Figure 2"></center><p>
Since the views are independent of each another, there is no consistent
geometric relationship between the two. This can result in an inability to
locate the position of the detailed region within the peripheral view, once
more bringing us back to the problem of spatial discontinuities. Navigation
under these conditions is typically difficult and slow. This is especially
severe when the scene being viewed is relatively homogeneous (e.g. through
tele-education, a large class of students). Normal human vision does not suffer
from this problem because the direction of the fovea explicitly dictates the
peripheral view.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC7">Linking Multiple Views
</a></h3>
To address the lack of a geometric relationship between the two views, we
indicate the detailed region within the global view by means of a yellow
bounding box (detail frame), as shown in Figure 3. The enclosed region
corresponds exactly to what is displayed in the detail view. As the detail view
changes, the bounding box on the global view adjusts accordingly.<p>
<center><IMG SRC="ky_fg3.gif" alt="Figure 3"></center><p>
Because the two views are logically linked, users can select a desired region
by sweeping out a bounding box or simply <i>point-and-click </i>on the global
view. &nbsp;In the former case, the detail view is defined by the size of the
bounding box, while in the latter, the detail view is centered at the selected
position and displayed at the maximum zoom. These interaction techniques with
the global view permit a far more efficient navigation mechanism than the
effectively <a href="ky_fn2.htm"><i>blind</i><sup><i> 2</i></sup></a> view selection offered by both
the original MTV system [12] and the Virtual Window system [10].<p>
In addition to control via the global view, the detail view can be manipulated
directly through the scroll bars, which provide tilt and pan control of the
motorized camera. It is also possible to adjust the zoom factor of the detail
view by pressing the left or right mouse button, or obtain a wide view by
selecting the <i>wide</i> button.<p>
To provide a linkage between the global and detail views, we require a mapping
between the coordinate systems of each, dependent on the properties of the
different cameras. We first define a global coordinate system, which covers the
entire area visible to both cameras. Next, we define models for each camera,
which consist of a view model, and in the case of the motorized camera, a
transformation function. The models describe the relationship between pixel
coordinates of each camera and the global coordinate system. In the case of our
fixed wide-angle camera, this is simply a one-to-one mapping. The
transformation function for the motorized camera maps pixel coordinates to the
appropriate motor signals. The models and relationships are described in Figure
4.<p>
<center><IMG SRC="ky_fg4.gif" alt="Figure 4"></center>
When a user selects an area of the global view, the pixel coordinates of this
region are first translated into global coordinates through the wide angle view
model, and then into pixel coordinates of the detail view. The detail pixel
coordinates are then mapped into motor signals via the transformation function.
Finally, the motor signals are sent to the detail camera. At the same time, the
updated location and dimensions of the bounding box are computed, and displayed
on the global view. Similarly, when a user specifies an area of the detail view
directly, the pixel coordinates of this region are transformed into motor
signals for the camera, and to global coordinates describing the new bounding
box.<p>
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC8">SENSORY SURROGATE
</a><br>
</h2>
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC9">Sensory surrogate for environmental awareness
</a></h3>
There exists no substitute for physical presence that offers the fidelity of
rapidly directable stereo vision and spatially sensitive binaural audio, as
manifested by the human senses. To help bridge the gap between physical
presence and telepresence in this regard, our Extra Eyes system provides users
with a <i>sensory surrogate</i> to increase their awareness of the remote
environment. The surrogate monitors background information obtained by sensors
and reports on relevant events through the use of sound, text, and graphics, or
a combination of the three. In this manner, background processing by the
computer is used to improve the user's foreground awareness.<p>
Sensors in the room [6] monitor the status of presentation technology such as
the VCR, document camera, and digital whiteboard, as well as the entry of new
individuals as depicted in Figure 5. When an event occurs, it triggers an
<i>alert-action sequence</i>. The alert corresponds to the screen message
displayed (e.g. "Someone has entered the room. Do you wish to view the
doorway?"), as well as the appearance of a blue bounding box (<i>alert box</i>)
in the corresponding region of the global view, as shown in Figure 3. If the
user acknowledges the alert by pushing the <i>OK</i> button or selecting the
<i>alert box,</i> then an appropriate action is executed by the system (e.g.
control the motorized camera to display the doorway). Another possible alert
message is "The VCR is now playing. Do you wish to view the tape?" with the
associated action of switching the user's view to the VCR output.<p>
<center><IMG SRC="ky_fg5.gif" alt="Figure 5"></center>
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC10">Sensory surrogate for social awareness
</a></h3>
We have also applied the sensory surrogate concept to increasing social
awareness among individuals sharing the media space of the Ontario Telepresence
Project [17]. The Postcards system (see Figure 6), based on Rank Xerox
EuroPARC's Portholes [8], captures snapshots from each user's office at set
intervals and distributes these to members of the media space. A sensory
surrogate in the Postcards system compares every two consecutive frames from
each office to determine if there is activity there. This is done by counting
the number of pixels that have changed by more than a certain threshold amount
between the two frames. Although the algorithm is susceptible to false
detection of activity due to camera perturbations, it has worked reasonably
well in our environment. Stored knowledge of activity allows Postcards to
determine whether individuals are in or out, or have recently entered or
vacated their offices.<p>
Users can take advantage of this background monitoring feature by asking the
system to <i>sense</i> activity and notify them when any number of individuals
are simultaneously present in their offices. This permits informal group
meetings to be established with a minimum of effort, freeing the user from the
mundane task of repeatedly checking to see who is available.<p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC11">EVALUATION</a><br>
</h2>
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC12">User Study
</a></h3>
We evaluated the performance of Extra Eyes through the following user study.
Three television monitors were arranged in a remote location, as shown in
Figure 7. Letters of the alphabet were displayed on a randomly chosen monitor,
one at a time. The user's task was to use the Extra Eyes system to identify
these letters as they appeared, as quickly as possible, while minimizing the
number of errors. Each letter would remain on the monitor until the user had
identified it, by typing its corresponding key. Once the letter was identified,
it would be replaced by another letter on a different monitor. The font size
was sufficiently small so that a zoom factor near the maximum was required for
legibility. We tested each of our seven subjects on the following conditions,
the order being randomly varied, with 20 repetitions per condition:<p>
<ul>
<li>1.	<b>No Global:</b> Only the detail view is visible. This situation is
equivalent to typical telepresence systems. <p>
<li>2. 	<b>No Global + Text: </b>Same as 1. In addition, a text alert indicates the
display on which the current letter appears.<p>
<li>3.	<b>Unlinked:</b> Both the global and detail views are simultaneously
visible, but the two views are not linked (i.e. neither view has effect on the
other). This is equivalent to the MTV system.<p>
<li>4.	<b>Linked:</b> Both the global and detail views are simultaneously visible
and linked.<p>
<li>5.	<b>Linked + Text:</b> Same as 4. In addition, a text alert indicates the
display on which the current letter appears.<p>
<li>6. 	<b>Linked + Action:</b> Same as 5. In addition, an <i>alert box</i>
appears, and the user can invoke the action corresponding to the alert by
pushing the <i>OK</i> button or by clicking anywhere within the <i>alert
box</i>. The action causes the camera to point directly to the new letter with
maximum zoom factor.
</ul>
<h3>
<center><IMG SRC="ky_fg7.gif" alt="Figure 7"></center><p></h3>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC13">Discussion and results of user study
</a></h3>
For the first three conditions, users exhibited two strategies to identify the
various letters. When no information beyond that of the detail view was
available, users consistently zoomed out to obtain a wide angle view, then
panned and tilted the camera to center the letter, before zooming in again.
This <i>zoom-out </i>strategy, represented by the solid line in the space-scale
diagram [9] of Figure 8a, requires over three camera operations, on average, to
identify each letter. When an alert message was added, indicating the display
on which the new letter appears, users tended to change their strategy. Knowing
the approximate location of the desired monitor from past experience gathered
during the study, users often tried to find this monitor by repeatedly panning
and tilting the camera, as shown by the solid line in Figure 8b. This strategy
is quite similar to searching for an object in a familiar room, while in the
dark. Because users cannot accurately select a desired position with the
<i>pan-tilt</i> strategy, this method often requires more operations than the
<i>zoom-out</i> strategy. The same <i>pan-tilt </i>strategy was used when the
global view was provided, but not linked to the detail view. For the remaining
three conditions, users were able to identify the letters with only a single
camera operation.<p>
<center><IMG SRC="ky_fg8.gif" alt="Figure 8"></center><p>

<center><IMG SRC="ky_fg9.gif" alt="Figure 9"><IMG SRC="ky_fg10.gif" alt="Figure 10"></center><p>
Figure 9 and Figure 10 present the results of our user study, indicating the average
number of camera operations users required to identify each letter, as well as
the average completion time with 95% confidence error bars, with each of the
six experimental conditions.<p>
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that both number of operations and trial
completion times were significantly affected by the experimental conditions.
For number of operations, F(5, 30)=55.2, p&lt;0.001. For completion time, F(5,
30)=40.1, p&lt;0.001.<p>
As measured by number of operations (Table A1 in the Appendix), Fisher's
protected LSD posthoc analyses showed that all linked conditions were
significantly different from the Unlinked and NoGlobal conditions (p&lt;0.05).
However, there is no significant difference among linked conditions. The
difference between Unlinked and NoGlobal, as well as Unlinked and NoGlobal+Text
is also insignificant.<p>
As measured by completion times (Table A2 in the Appendix), Fisher's protected
LSD posthoc analyses showed that all conditions were significantly different
from each other (p&lt;0.05), except Linked+Action vs. Linked+Text condition
(p=0.64) and NoGlobal vs. Unlinked (p=0.66).<p>
Based on these results, we can draw the following conclusions.<i></i>
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC14">Conclusion
1: Linkage between views is very important
</a></h4>
When the two views were linked, navigation in the remote environment via
selection in the global view was effortless. Any desired (visible) target could
be selected directly with a single camera operation, as indicated by the dashed
lines of Figures 8a and 8b (see also Figure 9). In this case, the previous
indirect strategies of <i>zoom-out </i>and <i>pan-tilt</i>, which require
almost twice as much time as direct selection, were never used. Users expressed
their opinion that the direct selection mechanism was more natural than the
indirect methods. Indeed, all linked conditions were significantly better than
the unlinked one in terms of both number of operations and trial completion
time. <p>
Further user feedback was also highly informative. Some commented that the<i>
detail frame</i> was useful as an indication of direction of camera motion.
Furthermore, when the two views were not linked, users had to remain conscious
of their current position in order to reach the desired view. This was a result
of spatial discontinuities [12]. Linkage between the two views reduced the
effect of these discontinuities, because a user action on one view has a direct
effect on the other. 
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC15">Conclusion
2: Sensory information is useful
</a></h4>
The time improvement from linked views to linked views with a text alert
(p&lt;0.05, see Table A2) indicates the added value of sensory information. As
most users explained, the alert allowed them to reduce the size of the visual
search area. Users also appreciated the audio feedback of a <i>beep</i>,
provided simultaneously with an alert message, indicating that a new letter was
about to appear.<p>
We note that sensory information may have compensated for the low update rate
(approximately 1-2 frames/s in our present implementation) of the global view.
In many instances, the indication of various alerts preceded the appearance of
a new letter on the global view by one second or more. This enabled users to
begin their navigation toward the desired monitor before the letter was
actually visible.<p>
Although the differences in time and number of operations between Linked+Text
and Linked+Action were not statistically significant, users indicated that the
graphic alerts were more useful than text messages. The graphic alerts
completely specify the relevant visual regions, as opposed to text alerts,
which require the user to read and then perform a search. Many users simply did
not read the text alerts, preferring instead to watch only the graphics
display. 
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC16">FURTHER
ISSUES
</a></h2>
Having described Extra Eyes and our preliminary evaluation of this system, we
now turn to some other issues.<p>
The global view provided by our present system can not capture a view of the
entire room. Other designers may prefer to use multiple cameras, or a very wide
angle lens, possibly a fisheye, for this task. In the former case, some form of
image processing will be required to combine the images, while in the latter,
unwarping to compensate for image distortion will be necessary.<p>
Detractors may argue that transmitting video for the global view is too
expensive. Either more bandwidth is required, or the frame rate of the detail
view will suffer. We suggest that since the global view is only required to
provide a sense of peripheral awareness, both its frame rate and resolution can
be relatively low. In fact, we reduced our global view to a quarter size (160 x
120 pixels), and found that users were still very aware of activities occurring
in the periphery. If the global view is transmitted at this size, along with a
full-frame detail view, both at the same rate, then the decrease in frame rate
of the detail view would be less than 7%, assuming constant bandwidth
consumption. We strongly believe that the benefit of peripheral awareness
justifies this minor expense.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC17">FUTURE WORK
</a></h2>
While the sense of peripheral awareness offered by a fixed global view is a
helpful navigation tool, it does not accurately replicate the mechanics of
human vision, in which the periphery is dictated by the orientation of the
fovea. A future version of Extra Eyes should remedy this shortcoming, either by
attaching the global camera to the motorized detail camera, or by using another
motorized camera for the global view, synchronized with the detail camera.<p>
This improvement is presently being applied to our initial large-screen
prototype, discussed earlier. To maximize effectiveness, we are locating the
smaller display near the center of the large screen. This way, the foveal and
peripheral cones will maintain the correct geometric relationship at all times.
We are presently combining such a system with the Virtual Window head-tracking
mechanism, and look forward to reporting on its results in the near future.<p>
An alternative route to pursue may be to make use of image processing
techniques, such as those of Warp California's Virtual TV (VTV) system, to
selectively unwarp any portion of the image from a fisheye lens. As higher
resolution and lower cost frame grabbers become available, this technology will
offer many advantages over motor-driven cameras.
<h2>
<a name="RTFToC18">CONCLUSIONS</a></h2>
We have crossed the complexity barrier of current camera-monitor mediated
telepresence applications. To beat the limitations imposed by this barrier, we
propose a new design to support views of the foveal and peripheral cones
simultaneously. To minimize the effects of spatial discontinuities, we also
provide a seamless linkage between the two views. Furthermore, a sensory
surrogate is needed to increase the remote user's sense of awareness. Acting
together, as they do in the Extra Eyes system, these techniques serve
dramatically to provide users with increased accessibility to remote locations.
