<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>

<P>
Recent work in computer graphics has resulted in new techniques
for rendering so-called <I>non-photorealistic</I> images. While
such features are now already appearing in commercially available
software, little is known about the effect of non-photorealistic
images on users and their usefulness in specific contexts.
<P>
In this paper we report on an empirical study with 54 architects
who compared the output of a sketch-renderer for producing pencil-like
drawings with standard output of CAD systems for architectural
designs. The results show that the different kinds of renditions
actually have a very different effect on viewers and that non-photorealistic
images actually do deserve their place in the repertoire of CAD
systems.
<H3>KEYWORDS: </h3>
non-photorealistic rendering, architectural presentation, preliminary drafts, sketches, CAD.

<H1>INTRODUCTION</H1>

<P>
There has been a recent flurry of activity in the area of computer
graphics away from the traditional photorealistic style of rendering.
Rather than to mimic a camera taking a picture of a real scene,
several new pieces of work have focused on producing images which
look hand-made. Examples of this trend are a renderer which produces
images which look like they were done using ink and pens [9][16],
pencils [12] and paintbrushes on canvas [10]. Commercial rendering
software like IRIS Inventor (Alias&#174;) and KATY (5D Solutions&#174;)
are also beginning to offer such rendering possibilities.
<P>
At first one may surmise that such features are merely marketing
gimmicks to improve the sales of rendering software. In this paper
we put this hypothesis to test and study the usefulness of such
non-photorealistic rendered images. To do so, we work with a highly
interactive sketch-renderer which was designed to produce pencil-like
drawings of architectural designs prepared with CAD software.
We report on a study with 54 architects who analysed several renditions
of the same scene and reported on their impressions.
<H1>PHOTOREALISTIC AND NON-PHOTOREALISTIC IMAGES: A USER'S PERSPECTIVE
</H1>

<H2>Techniques</H2>

<P>
It is no longer possible to define precisely what is meant when
the term &quot;computer graphics&quot; is used in the literature.
Most images which reach the eyes of viewers today were processed
by computer somewhere along the line, be it by a scanner, a drawing
program or a renderer.
<P>
Drawing programs and renderers lie on opposite ends of the spectrum
with respect to user interaction. The former offer users almost
complete freedom to draw an image given certain primitives; even
the manipulation of individual pixels is possible. Renderers,
on the other hand, read in a geometric model and generally produce
an image whose appearance can hardly be modified, except by post-processing
[13].
<P>
The style of rendering which practically all research has focused
on in the last 15 years has been photorealism [3]. Hence users
wishing to produce such images have some of the same freedom as
a normal camera offers: the camera position and the lighting can
be adjusted and in some cases also depth-blurring. Advanced features
are often implemented, such as special environmental conditions
like fog [2] or unusual perspective transformations [8].
<P>
This restriction to photorealism is convenient as its goal is
well-defined, which is simply to convince viewers that the image
is in fact a photo
<P>
[3, plate III.19]. It is easily possible to assess the success
or failure of a renderer to reach this goal (at least at a superficial
level). Furthermore, photorealism poses no new problems with respect
to usability, since the output is (at least in principle) the
same as with a camera.
<P>
Non-photorealistic rendering software does not define the kind
of output as precisely as when photorealism is the goal. Non-photorealistic
images vary greatly in style and quality in the same way as human
artists renditions vary. Such renderers provide interesting challenges
from an algorithmic as well as from an artistic point of view.
Lansdown and Schofield [7] recently surveyed the developments
in this area.
<P>
The introduction of non-photorealism makes it much more difficult
to define goals for what the software should actually be able
to achieve and how it should be used. In the present context,
it is important to note that such software also places a greater
emphasis on the user, because he or she must interact with the
renderer to fine-tune the image. This includes selecting the overall
style of rendering as well as modifying individual features of
the image. Hence aspects of human-computer interaction with rendering
software are becoming important.
<H2>Interaction with a Sketch-Renderer</H2>

<P>
To illustrate how users interact with renderers which produce
non-photorealistic images, we shall describe one such system.
It is <I>the sketch-renderer</I>, a system developed by the authors
[12] for producing images which resemble hand-made drawings with
pencil on paper. It is the tool which was used to produce one
of the images assessed later on in this paper.
<P>
The input to the sketch-renderer is a three-dimensional model
in the DXF-format which is commonly used in CAD-software. The
sketch-renderer first produces a wire-frame image as is normally
produced in CAD. In order to give the user full control over the
style of a presentation, the sketch-renderer strictly separates
the geometric model from the stylistic information which can be
assigned to single objects. This enables the sketch-renderer to
read in models which were perhaps intended for another renderer,
while keeping separate the stylistic information of which only
the sketch-renderer makes use. The user can fine-tune the following
parameters with the &quot;point and click&#148; method using the
interactive sketch editor:
<UL>
<LI><I>line styles</I> with width, edge quality, contour, waviness,
colour saturation, saturation progression, length of segments,
variation of segments from baseline, and connection of segments,
and
<LI><I>hatching styles</I> with density of lines, line pattern,
angle of lines, segmentation of hatching lines, and deviation
from regular hatching.
</UL>

<P>
These parameters can be combined with each other, e.g. the lines
used for cross-hatching may be different from those used for contours.
Hatching can be used to represent textures and shadows; the latter
are calculated depending on a light source. Changes can be seen
immediately on the screen and can be saved to so-called configuration
file. An impression of how users can work with the sketch-renderer
is given in Figure 1.
<CENTER>
<P><img src="chi1.gif"><P>
Figure 1: <I>The interactive sketch-renderer has an easy to use
point-and-click interface.</I> </CENTER>
<H2>Open Problems</H2>

<P>
Graphics which are produced with current CAD programs do not reach
the expressiveness of hand-made drawings. With the sketch-renderer,
by contrast, an architect can produce more individual views of
an object being planned; these seem to be appropriate especially
in earlier stages of design. In order to verify this, we carried
out a survey among potential users of the system. This is described
in the following section.
<H1>AN EMPIRICAL STUDY</H1>

<H2>Goals</H2>

<P>
The goal of our study is to compare the usability of computer-generated
images with respect to communicative goals during development
of design concepts. We use three computer-generated images: an
exact CAD plot, a shaded image and a sketch generated by our sketch
renderer. The first of these is the &quot;normal&quot; output
of CAD software; the second is often available in CAD software
(though not used as much in practice), while the third is still
at an experimental stage.
<P>
We are investigating three aspects of presentations:
<OL>
<LI>use of different media in the different phases of the design
process,
<LI>judgement of the impression which images make on viewers,
and
</OL>
<CENTER>
<P><img src="chi2.gif"><P>
Figure 2: <I>The CAD plot</I>
</CENTER>
<OL>
<LI>how viewers are stimulated to express changes to the design.
</OL>

<H2>Hypotheses</H2>

<P>
We are interested in the situation in which an architect would
use the images. Since an architect's goal is in general to attract
attention to the image, we hypothesize that
<P>
<I>H1 For presentations of early drafts of architectural designs,
sketches are the preferred over CAD plots and shaded images.</I>

<P><CENTER><img src="chi3.gif"><P>
Figure 3: <I>The shaded image</I> </CENTER>
<P>
Furthermore, we hypothesize that there is a marked difference
in the way the three images affect their viewers. To structure
our hypothesis, we refer to the classification scheme of Peeck
(see Willows and Houghton [15]), who divides the possible effects
of an image into three groups:
<UL>
<LI>a <I>cognitive</I> group, pertaining to aspects like the understandability,
clarity or spatiality of the image,
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>an <I>affective</I> group, to assess emotional aspects, like
how interesting or imaginative an image appears, and
<UL>
<LI>a <I>motivational</I> group, measuring to what extent users
are encouraged to participate in the design process.
</UL>

</UL>

<P>
We hypothesize that
<P><CENTER><img src="chi4.gif"><P>
Figure 4: <I>The computer-generated sketch</I> </CENTER>
<P>
<I>H2 Sketches perform better in the communication of affective
and motivational aspects, while exact plots and shaded images
perform better in cognitive aspects.</I> 
<P>
Finally, we expect the exact plot to arouse more interest in the
actual design of the object being visualized, which leads us to
the hypothesis that
<P>
<I>H3 Sketches stimulate viewers more than shaded images to discuss
and actively participate in design development</I> 
<P>
The psychological context of these hypotheses is taken up in the
discussion section later on in the paper.
<H2>Method</H2>

<P>
<I>Subjects</I>. A questionnaire was given to approximate 150
architects and architectural students in several cities in Germany.
Of these, 54 (36%) returned it, having answered the questions.
Of those returning the questionnaire, 67% replied that they regularly
use CAD.
<P>
<I>Design</I>. Subjects where shown three different images, each
portraying the same object (see Figures 2 to 4) which was designed
by students of architecture as a term project. The CAD plot (ordinary
wire-frame image with hidden-line removal) was produced with AutoCAD&#153;,
the image with constant shading was generated by the RenderMan&#153;
renderer, while the sketch was produced with the sketch-renderer
described above. Note that all three images were produced from
the same geometric model in the DXF-format.
<P>
After being shown the three images, subjects were asked to answer
various questions. First, they were asked to say which image(s)
they would want to use to show a first draft to a client and which
image they would use for a final presentation. They were also
asked to provide a verbal explanation of their choice.
<P>
Next, subjects were asked about a number of (possible) effects
of the images, classified according to Peeck's scheme mentioned
above. These were to be rated on a scale of 5 (&quot;strongly
disagree&quot;) to 1 (&quot;strongly agree&quot;). Subjects were
also asked to give an additional verbal judgement about the images,
which is not described here but is valuable help for further implementations.
<P>
To test the third hypothesis, subjects were asked to say how they
would make changes to the design being visualized. They were given
four options to choose from:
<P>
(a) using a verbal description,
<P>
(b) by gesturing or by pointing relative to the image,
<P>
(c) by drawing on another sheet of paper, or

for the presentation of a first draft versus the presentation

<P>
(d) by drawing directly onto the image.
<H1>RESULTS</H1>

<H2>Use of Images during the Design Process</H2>

<P>
Of those subjects using CAD, 53% chose the sketch as a suitable
way to present a first draft to a client. This is significantly
more than those suggesting the shaded image (22%), as well as
the exact plot, which was chosen by 33% of subjects.
<P>
Subjects preferring the sketch generally argued that it best shows
the preliminary character of the draft and does not focus on details
which are, at this stage, not yet decided upon. Many of those
who chose the shaded image commented that they appreciated the
ability to present the spatial concept of the design.
<P>
By contrast, only 8% chose the sketch to present a final result
to a client, which is significantly less than those choosing the
exact plot (50%) and the shaded image (42%) (p &lt; 0.05). Subjects
who chose the exact plot or the shaded image often argued that
the selection committee &quot;want to see exact renditions&#148;,
while those few who choose the sketch commented on its originality
and the desire to stand out against competitors. Figure 5 summarizes
the results.
<H2>Impression Made by the Images</H2>

<P>
Subjects had to assess the impression of the three images in more
detail. The results in Figure 6 show that sketches were found
significantly more interesting, lively, imaginative, creative,
individual and less artificial than both the other media (affective
group). Furthermore, they were found to stimulate significantly
more to discussions and active changes, in which shaded images
performed worst.
<P>
In sharp contrast to these affective criteria, the CAD plot performed
significantly better in the cognitive group, being more comprehensible,
recognizable and clear than both the other media. The shaded image
was found to support spatial concepts better, but differences
were not significant.

<P>
 
<P>
While the observations so far were concerned with assessing which
impression architectural presentations make on viewers, it is
an important goal of the communication between architects and
their clients to explain ideas mutually and to develop them further.
Therefore, an important criterion in the assessment of the effectiveness
of a presentation medium is its ability to provoke active participation
of the partners within a discussion.
<P>
The results in Figure 7 illustrate that in both media, the methods
(a), (b) and (c) were used nearly equally often (the differences
are not signifcant). However, drawing directly into the image
was chosen significantly more often (p &lt; 0.05) in sketches
than in shaded images (69% vs. 33%).
<H1>DISCUSSION</H1>

<P>
All three of our hypotheses could be proven by the experiments
carried out. To explain the results, we shall now look at them
from a theoretic point of view. We would expect the cognitive
effort required by viewers to be greater for sketches than for
the other two kinds of images tested. This is because sketches
are more irregular in their form, which means that they transport
more information to their viewers. This, in turn, increases the
cognitive effort required to understand them (see Klix [6]).
<P>
Indeed, Weidenmann [13] speaks of<I> normalization demands</I>
being placed on a viewer in order to decipher an image. By the
above reasoning, these are higher for sketches than CAD plots
or shaded images. Applying the ideas of Berlyne's &quot;collative
variables&quot; [1], normalization demands lead to curiosity,
which in turn is linked to interest and creativity, resulting
in a high level of motivation [6].
<P>
Going back now to our hypothesis H2, we can explain the less favourable
score of the sketch in the cognitive group with the difficulty
in deciphering the irregular forms; the resultant ambiguities,
however, are then responsible for the better scores in the affective
and in the motivational groups.
<P>
This reasoning also explains the results of H1. In a first draft,
architects reported they want to arouse interest in their designs,
which by the reasoning above is higher with sketches. For a final
draft, a good score in the cognitive group is more important,
hence the shaded images and CAD plots are preferred.
<P>
To explain H3, we need to go one step further in the theoretic
background. Gombrich [5] speaks of the process of <I>projection</I>
of our experience and expectations onto the phenomena seen. This
requires firstly empty or vague places in a picture which can
act as a &quot;projection screen&quot;, and secondly hints to
direct the viewer as to how these gaps can be filled. By this
reasoning, sketches provide more projection space than shaded
images (because in these practically the whole area of the image
is filled, and hence cannot act as a projection space quite as
well). Sketches also provide more projection space than CAD plots,
because there is no room for interpretation as to where and how
lines (i.e., edges in the object visualized) meet. More projection
space thus can explain the greater willingness of viewers of sketches
to enter into a discussion about the design.
<P>
These explanations are only rudimentary analyses of the results;
more would go beyond the scope of this paper (see [11] for more
details).
<H1>CONCLUDING REMARKS</H1>

<P>
In this paper we have shown that indeed non-photorealistic images
are able to affect viewers of images in a different way than photorealistic
images are. Care must be taken not to overgeneralize the results
by making specific claims about other kinds of images than the
ones evaluated in this paper. However, the present study suggest
that sketches in the context of CAD indeed deserve their place
in rendering software and can be used in an effective manner by
architects. Fine-tuning an image actually changes the way the
viewer thinks about the design itself.
<P>
An intuitively pleasing result of our study is the significant
difference in the way the cognitive and affective factors differ.
Affective (i.e., emotional) factors are supported significantly
more by sketches, while cognitive factors (like comprehensibility
of the image) are significantly better with CAD plots or shaded
images.
<P>
The results clearly indicate that using sketches encourages discourse
about a design. Hence if an architect wishes to enter into such
a discussion, a sketch is the medium of choice; if the design
is no longer to be altered, CAD plots or shaded images are preferable.
This conclusion is in tune with the observations of Yin Yin [17],
who contends that sketches are more readily accepted as being
incomplete representations than more polished forms of visualization.
<P>
We expect the ability to produce non-photorealistic images to
alter significantly the way users work with CAD. No longer can
users divorce themselves from the way their image looks in the
final output; the user must take responsibility for the appearance
and also its effect on the viewer. The new freedom which users
have will also allow them to make mistakes, both in the equilibrium
of the image as well as in the intended effect on the viewer.
New concepts will have to be developed to help guide users in
their work to fine-tune images for their final presentation.
<P>
From the technical point of view, the sketch-renderer must be
extended to improve the output for large, complex architectural
models. In particular, algorithms and interaction techniques must
be found which will enable less detail to be visualized in an
image than is actually encoded in the underlying model. This will
be of particular importance when using such renditions as to show
a first draft of a design to a client.
<P>
The bottom line is that the new features of non-photorealism in
renderers are definitely worthwhile, as they offer users a new
degree of freedom which can be used to affect the viewers of the
images. However, users will need to learn more about when to use
which image along the lines we have shown in this paper.
