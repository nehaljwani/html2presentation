<a name="RTFToC2">Abstract</a></h3>
While several studies propose methods and notations for "capturing" design
rationale (DR), there is to date little data available on how useful this
information is when a designer needs to reuse a previous design. This paper
presents the results of an empirical evaluation of DR documents, carried out
with six experienced professional designers who were asked to understand and to
assess a past design. These designers were provided with documents that
described the solution and documents describing the DR. These DR documents were
constructed using the QOC method. To determine the usefulness of DR documents,
we attempt to answer the three following questions: (1) Do designers confronted
with an unknown design need to know the design rationales? (2) How designers
use design rationale documents? (3) Do we succeed in capturing the rationales
looked for by designers? The results provided by this study lead us to conclude
that DR should be useful, at least for some designers who use it as a support
to their reasoning, but not sufficient. Indeed, this study exhibits some
limitations of the traditional approaches for recording DR. We discuss these
limitations and some solutions needed to go beyond them.

Introduction
</a></h2>
Recent studies have used methods, notations and tools for recording,
representing and accessing design rationale [5, 2]. It is argued that design
rationale (DR) is necessary for reusing past designs, coordinating people
involved in a long project [6], promoting critical reflection during design
[7], facilitating maintenance and the use of the artifact [3]. A commonly
advocated framework for recording and representing design rationale is argument
structure (e.g., gIBIS [6], DRL [11], QOC [12], DRCS [10]). This framework
proposes to represent DR with a semi-structured approach, implying different
nodes: <i>questions</i> or <i>issues</i>, <i>options</i> related to these
issues, <i>arguments</i> or <i>criteria</i> involved in the assessment of these
options, and <i>justifications</i>. <p>
While this framework is claimed to be appropriate for the capture and
subsequent use of DR, there is little empirical data on how useful DR documents
constructed using this framework really are (but see [13] for a review related
to this issue). By DR documents, we mean paper documents or electronic
documents containing a semi-formal description of the DR. This paper presents a
first experiment aimed at evaluating the usefulness of such documents.<p>
The first requirement of this evaluation was to record the DR of a design
project. This has been possible with the collaboration of a French aerospace
company, Aerospatiale. We recorded the DR of a real industrial project
conducted in a design office of this company. This design office specialises in
mechanical engineering design. The goal of the design project was to evolve one
of their products to meet new requirements (redesign). We examined the first
phase of this project, which lasted for nine months. This study received the
project manager's support, because he was convinced that a DR document could be
a helpful information tool for those in charge of the next phases of the
project.<p>
To record the DR of this project, we used the QOC formalism [12]. Two reasons
explain this choice: (1) to carry out a first experiment in an industrial
setting, we needed a fairly simple method; IBIS (see [6]) and QOC meet this
requirement; (2) one of the main differences between IBIS and QOC is that it is
necessary to make <i>design criteria</i> explicit with QOC, while they may
remain hidden in the <i>arguments</i> defending the <i>positions</i> with IBIS.
The ability to be directly informed about the design criteria was judged by the
project manager to be an indispensable requirement. Indeed, this makes it
possible to immediately know the project objectives, and thus, to better assess
the solution.<p>
The record of the DR was ensured by two scribes, a company documentation
specialist and the author. This was a condition required by the design office
chief, who did not believe that the designers would take the time to document
the DR themselves. Both scribes played a purely passive role in the design
process. The DR record was based on the analysis of 4 audiotaped design
meetings, bringing together mechanical engineers and technicians. Each design
meeting lasted two hours.<p>
The DR document was structured by reporting the new facts discussed at each new
design meeting. After each formalization of a meeting using QOC, we asked the
project team to review the new version of the DR document. The final document
contains 31 questions, 46 options, 25 criteria, and 12 justifications of the
option assessments.<p>
This document was paper-based. Indeed, the company where the study was carried
out preferred to first test the DR capturing method without any computer
support, before investing in such a tool. One consequence of this choice is
that the evaluation performed and presented in this paper does not cope with
some aspects affecting the usefulness of DR documents. In particular, we do not
evaluate how easy the access to the DR is, because this feature is completely
dependant on the provided means for access.<p>
Because the document was paper-based, we tried to respect the following rules
intended to make it easier to read : (i) one problem per page; (ii) a recall of
the origin of each question with a title at the top of each page, (iii) a
graphic symbol for each type of node (questions were encircled, chosen options
in a square frame, etc.), (iv) each node numbered to provide annexes with
complete lists of each type of node (list of questions, list of criteria,
etc.), with the number of each node and its wording.<p>
In order to explore how useful DR documents are, three questions were
addressed: (1) Do designers confronted with an unknown design need to know the
design rationales? Depending on this answer, we will be able to say at least if
DR documents should be useful; (2) Do designers use design rationale documents?
Indeed, no matter what the designers' need for DR is, if they do not use DR
documents, this would highlight serious limitations of our approach; (3) Do we
succeed in capturing the rationales looked for by designers? Here too, if
designers need DR, but if they do not find the facts that they are looking for
in the DR documents, we will need to revise our approach. This paper presents
the results of different analyses related to these three issues. We will
finally conclude by recalling the lessons learned by this study.<p>
The experiment presented in this paper was carried out in the field of
mechanical engineering design. However, we believe that the lessons learned by
this study should be valuable for other fields of design, because our
conclusions are more concerned with the approach for capturing DR than with the
application domain.<p><p>

<a name="RTFToC4">2.
Method
</a></h2>
In order to evaluate the usefulness of DR documents (for convenience, we will
use "DR" to refer to "DR document"), we asked six experienced, professional
designers (three engineers and three technicians), all external to the project
that we examined, to understand and to assess the solution proposed by the
project team. These tasks were chosen because they are considered by the
designers themselves as the most important when they need to work on the
results of a previous study.<p>
During an evaluation meeting, a designer was provided with two kinds of
information: (i) information describing the solution, and consisting mostly of
blueprints; (ii) information describing the reasons for design decisions, and
reported in a paper-document.<p>
Designers were free to use blueprints and DR as they chose: this means that we
did not force them to use the DR. This was necessary because we were interested
in knowing how they would spontaneously use it. In addition, the documentation
specialist and I were present to help find the information looked for by
designers, or to answer their questions. Actually, our initial intention was to
let the designers finding themselves their answers in the DR. However, because
some of them systematically asked questions to us, we decided to give the
appropriate answers, and thus, not to jam the natural process. One consequence
of this decision is that we will not be able to draw conclusions about the
usability of DR documents (but see [13], which reports some empirical data on
usability of DR).<p>
Each evaluation meeting proceeded as follows: we described the tasks assigned
to the designer, and presented the documents available. Because the DR was a
new type of document, we described its properties and how it should be
interpreted. Then the designer began his/her tasks, without time constraints.
At the end, we asked a few questions on his/her opinions concerning the
usefulness of the DR. These evaluation meetings lasted about one hour each, and
were all taped.<p><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC5">3.
Do designers confronted with an unknown design need to know the design rationale?
</a></h2>
In order to measure the importance of knowing the design rationales, we examine
the <i>questions</i> raised by the designers confronted with a design solution
during the evaluation meetings.<p>
One hundred and thirty eight questions were extracted from the 6 evaluation
meetings. These questions were coded according to the following categories:<p>
1. <i>Blueprints questions</i>: they aim at clarifying the objects represented
(e.g., pointing at a blueprint "what is this element?"); this category also
includes requests for other blueprints.<p>
2. <i>Structure questions: </i>they concern the material used, the forms and
the size of the objects composing the whole artifact, and the properties of the
interfaces between these objects (e.g., "how is the plate that carries the
equipment fixed?")<p>
3. <i>Behavior questions:</i> they focus on the way the artifact carries out
its functions (e.g., "What are the moves allowed by this arm?")<p>
4. <i>Design rationale questions: </i>they ask about the initial motivations of
the project, the reasons for the design decisions, the different possible
choices and the comparison between these different choices (e.g., "Why 6 fuel
tanks, and not just 4 bigger ones?").<p>
5. <i>History questions</i>: typically, they include questions about what has
changed between the previous design and the new one, mostly concentrating on
the structural aspect of the artifact ("Did you change the way the plate is
fixed?")<p>
6. <i>Document questions</i>: they aim at clarifying the terms used in the DR
documents, and to better understand the way these documents were constructed
(e.g., "How did you decide to link one criteria to one option?").<p>
Figure 1 gives the percentages of occurrence that we found for each category of
questions.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="lk_fig1.gif"><p>
<b>Figure 1</b>. <i>Percentage of questions during evaluation meetings</i><p>
<i></i><p>
This diagram shows that <i>DR questions are by far the most frequent</i>. In
addition, this result remains true whatever the designers' competence is (63%
of DR questions for engineers; 49% for technicians).<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC6">Discussion
</a></h3>
These results clearly establish that designers need to know the design
rationale to understand and assess an unknown design.<p>
However, one must note that these results contradict Herbsled and Kuwana's
observations [8]: their analysis of questions in design meetings stated that
design rationale questions (referred to as <i>why</i> questions) were rare.
They then proposed different possible explanations of this result, among which:
"the rationale behind decisions is simply relatively unimportant" (p.13). If
this is true, how can we explain the high frequency of DR questions in our
study ?<p>
The discrepancy between our respective results might be due to the fact that
<i>question asking is a situated, context-dependent activity</i>. In other
words, questions observed in a specific situation, namely design meetings,
cannot be considered as representative of questions asked in another situation,
namely reuse situations. And indeed, there are two major differences between
both situations:<p>
1. Some previous studies [9] highlight the fact that explanations are most of
the time given <i>spontaneously</i> in design dialogues, and not in response to
a question. More precisely, in analyzing database design dialogues, it was
found that 83% of the explanations were volunteered when one member of the
group wanted to submit a proposal or to address a critic. As a consequence, one
observes few explicit why questions in such design dialogues.<p>
2. Furthermore, because participants in a project accumulate knowledge on this
project (the requirements, constraints, problems with different alternatives,
etc.), they are able to infer, in some cases, why such a proposal or such a
criticism is relevant, without asking the corresponding why question. <p>
Both aspects are present in the design meetings studied by Herbsleb and Kuwana,
and missing from our evaluation meetings, where designers had to work with a
previous design without having the historical knowledge of the project. Our
conclusion is that knowing the design rationale is important, especially when
the project team works on someone else's design.<p>
This conclusion would appear as a strong argument for claiming the usefulness
of DR documents if at least two conditions were satisfied: the first condition
would be that designers want to use DR documents; the second condition would be
that DR documents constructed with the QOC method contain the information
looked for by designers. We test these conditions in the two following
sections.<p><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC7">4.
Do designers use design rationale documents?
</a></h2>
The evaluation meetings have allowed us to identify two very distinctive ways
of using the DR: an opportunistic use and an extensive use.<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC8">The
opportunistic use of DR
</a></h3>
The first way of using the DR is to look at it only when no other means allow a
designer to answer his/her question. Among these other means are: the inference
of the reasons for the decisions, and the verbal asking.<p>
Indeed, very often when a designer raises a DR question, he/she first looks
more precisely at the blueprints. In doing so, he/she tries to gain more
information on the structural and functional aspects of the artifact. The new
information found in this way (they also might ask a question) helps to infer
the reasons for the design decisions. The following extract gives an example of
how a better understanding of the artifact helps to discover the design
rationale ("D" stands for designer, "DS" for documentation specialist, "* *"
for personal comments):<p>
<p>
D: 	(talking to himself) <i>So, what lead to the choice of these tanks?</i>
(Now, he turns towards us) <i>What is the principle of these tanks? Is the
pressurization external or internal?</i><p>
<i></i>DS: <i>Internal</i>.<p>
D: 	<i>Ok, so one may assume that the cost was a criteria of choice in this
case </i>(*in fact, internal pressurization is cheaper than external
pressurization*).<p>
<p>
This extract highlights the fact that an improved understanding of the
structure or of the behavior of the artifact makes it possible in numerous
cases to answer DR questions. However, this is not always possible. The
designer may then try to find the information looked for in the DR. This is
what we call an opportunistic use of a document.<p>
This kind of use could have been expected if we had related the use of DR with
the use of manuals, guidelines, written instructions, etc. Indeed, several user
studies (e.g., [4]) reported that users usually prefer to act before reading
any documentation. This is what seems to happen with our designers.<p>
No other study could have prepared us to observe the opposite way of using the
DR, which we call an extensive use.<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC9">The
extensive use of DR
</a></h3>
All three engineers, and two of them more significantly, began to analyze the
blueprints, then looked for information in the DR, and based their
understanding of the design on an extensive reading of the DR. By extensive
reading, we mean the attempt to understand each issue reported inside the
document, one after the other. However, we also noted that these designers
rarely used the DR alone: regularly, they went back to the blueprints. In doing
so, they expressed not only the need for visualizing the chosen option referred
to in the DR, but also their desire to make their own judgement. The following
extract illustrates this sequence of behaviors:<p>
<p>
D: 	(reading a DR question) "<i>How can we reduce the vibrations at the DAAV
level?"...first option "Design with DIAS"...ok, but it does not satisfy the
weight criteria Right. "New design of the high level without DIAS</i>" (*this
is the second option*) <i>... ok ...could we look at the blueprints now</i>
(turning towards the blueprints) ...<i>Ah ok, so here, the bottom of the
ferrule comes under the DAAV, doesn't it ? </i> (*this structural item explains
how it is possible to reduce vibrations and weight at the same time by
comparison with the previous design*).<p>
DS : <i>Yes, that's it.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
In contrast to the opportunistic use, an extensive reading of the DR then
mainly implies the following behavioral pattern: from DR to blueprints, or in
other words, from design reasoning to the solution. <p>
Note that for designers who extensively read the DR, a paper format of the DR
might be more appropriate than a computerized format.<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC10">Discussion:
An explanation of why designers use the DR differently
</a></h3>
We asked one engineer why he seemed to prefer reading the DR over a deeper
analysis of the blueprints. He commented: "With the blueprints, I can only
notice that the new design is different from the previous one. But to
understand why and to assess the results of the project, I need to know the
problems raised by the previous design. This document (the DR) provides such
information."  This comment suggests that some designers will use the DR not
just as a punctual provider of information, but more significantly as a support
for their reasoning. However this comment does not account for those designers
who do not express the need to extensively read the DR, except if we consider
that those designers have some <i>contextualization capacities</i> that others
do not. By contextualization capacities, we mean the cognitive ability to
create a context of information that will help in understanding and assessing a
design. In fact, this is what we observed: the three designers who developed an
opportunistic use of the DR found out by themselves (i.e., without reading the
DR) numerous problems raised by the previous design once they knew the specific
requirements for the new design; they evoked many alternatives, which helped
them to make some comparisons with the presented design; and they constructed
their own explanations of the choices made by deducing some possible criteria
used by the project team. Probably because they were more experienced, and
certainly because they were used to working on initial phases of projects where
it is usual to search for and to balance many alternatives, they were able to
provide by themselves a context sufficient to interpret the design
rationales.<p>
However, it is also important to stress the fact that the reasons found by
these more experienced designers were not always right, even if they were
satisfied by them[1]. This reveals that
designers do not look for the<i> real reasons</i> for design decisions: finding
out <i>some</i> <i>good reasons</i> seems sufficient. This also explains the
fact that some designers rarely consult the DR, even if they are interested in
the design rationales.<p>
All these considerations lead us to revise our initial assumptions about DR
documents: it is not because such documents (whether paper or electronic) are
available that they will be consulted, even if they contain information needed
by designers!<p>
Our approach to circumvent this difficulty, at least partially, consists in
including some facts which make up the design rationale such as comments on the
blueprints (or any representation of the solution). Such an approach assumes
that the documentation specialist will be able to select the important facts
from the sets of facts composing the DR. It also assumes that designers will
use an interface that offers them the possibility of hiding or showing the DR
comments.<p><p>

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC11">5.
Do we succeed in capturing the rationales looked for by designers?
</a></h2>
In order to evaluate the usefulness of DR documents, it is necessary to compare
the designers' questions with the content of these documents. Indeed, it will
be possible to claim that DR is useful only if designers' questions can be
answered by such documents.<p>
To address this issue, we accounted for the DR questions expressed by the
designers that were answered by the DR. We considered that a designer's DR
question was answered by the DR either if the designer found an answer in it,
or if we provided him/her with a verbal answer which existed in the document.
Seventy six DR questions were identified in this way. <p>
We found that <i>41%</i> of the designers' DR questions (31 out of 76) were
answered by the DR. In addition, we noticed that this result did not
significantly vary according to the designers' competence (43% for the
technicians, 38% for the engineers).<p>
These results alone are difficult to judge: for some, they may be viewed as a
good result, because nothing existed before! For others, they may be considered
as insufficient. To better assess these results, an analysis of the causes
explaining why some DR questions were not answered by the DR was performed.<p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC12">Analyzing
the discrepancy between DR questions and the DR captured
</a></h3>
Four categories of causes were identified, each one including different types
of causes (see table 1):<p>

</pre>
<p>
<b>Table 1.</b> <i>The causes and their frequencies explaining the discrepancy
between designers' DR questions and the content of the DR document</i><p>
<p>
1. <i>Causes related to the DR analysts</i>: 14 designers' questions were not
answered because the analysts had not reported some facts, even though these
facts were discussed during the design meetings recorded. Looking at these
facts more closely, we found that some of them were not reported because the
analysts had simply forgotten to report them. Others were not reported because
the analysts might decide, not always consciously, that given information was
not important, because given the current state of design elaboration, it was
not essential. For instance, during the project, the designers had decided to
elaborate one alternative among three, simply because they wanted to quickly
test one idea, and not because this alternative was judged better than the
other ones; however, at the end of the first phase of the project, only this
alternative was elaborated, and during the evaluation meetings, the designers
were provided only with the blueprints of this solution. Some of them asked
why. We knew the answer, but it was not reported in the DR. In short, for
different reasons related to the analyst, some known facts may not be included
in the DR document. This observation may induce two opposite reactions: one may
want to reduce this number, for instance by asking the analyst to be more
"rigorous", or by introducing more controls in the DR elaboration. We believe
that such an approach will be inadequate. Indeed, one has to note that, because
it was the first time that we tried to capture the DR, we were as "rigorous" as
possible. Introducing more controls does not seem to be the solution either: we
did ask the project team to review the DR document after each new meeting; this
team was also motivated by the fact that it was the first time that such an
experiment was attempted within the company. However, these review meetings
also were not sufficient to ensure the completeness of our document.<p>
Considering these arguments, another reaction is possible: we need to introduce
an <i>iterative approach</i> to DR capture. We believe that a DR document must
be conceived as something unfinished at the end of a project. This document
should be improved with the questions raised by its subsequent use. This
improvement process should be centralized at the level of the DR analyst:
he/she should receive the designers' questions, then answer them, and at the
same time decide if some facts need to be added to the existing documents or
not. If a computer tool is introduced to access the design rationale, this
means that we must provide the user with the possibility of asking questions
and receiving answers through the system (electronic mail for instance).<p>
<i>2. Causes related to the QOC method</i>: the only problem noticed with QOC
concerned its relative inability to represent weighted evaluation (X is better
than Y according to criteria Z). Actually, it is possible with the use of
link-thickness, but readers often fail to correctly interpret it. As a
consequence, it was not possible to answer questions like "According to
criteria Z, is X or Y better?" Some authors (e.g., [11]) claim that this kind
of information is necessary, and include it as a requirement for DR capture
support tools. However, because this problem was noticed only once in our
study, we did not decide to modify our original notation.<p>
3. <i>Causes related to the readers</i>: this category contains the highest
number of questions unanswered (19 out of 45 in all). It includes two different
types of cause: <p>
- <i>readers' misconceptions</i>: most of the time, a DR question based on a
misconception has no DR answer. For instance, a question such as "Why did they
change the whole structure?" has no answer if only some parts of the whole
structure were changed. The most frequent misconceptions encountered in our
data were due either to a misundertanding of the artifact structure (4/12), a
misunderstanding of the artifact functions (3/12), an incomplete or incorrect
knowledge of the previous design (2/12), or facts learned during the meeting
that were forgotten (2/12). It is important to note that misconceptions
represent one factor that contributes to making wrong decisions in design,
especially when a designer has to choose between different alternatives. These
misconceptions were often not due to a lack of information, but to an
incomplete analysis of the blueprints provided. We then believe that these
misconceptions will always exist, because it is difficult to change the way
people work in their daily settings. If we accept this statement, we must look
for mechanisms of detection and correction of these misconceptions. One
possible approach that we choose to explore further consists in taking
advantage of the internal network of the company. We have said that designers
should be able to ask questions directly to the DR analyst. The analyst will
then be able to correct some designers' misconceptions.<p>
- the problem of <i>inappropriate questions</i> is specific to our study.
Because the design presented was only the result of the first phase of the
project, several formal proofs (calculations) were not yet available. The
designers may ask for these formal proofs if they are not convinced by the
justifications provided in the DR. These questions are inappropriate, given the
current state of design development. However, they are not inappropriate with
respect to the designer's needs. As a consequence, we have learned from this
observation that we will need to include in the DR the formal proofs that will
be established later. These formal proofs will be represented as justifications
of evaluations.<p>
4<i>. Causes related to the project team</i>: this last category of causes is
one of the most interesting, because it highlights that some claims concerning
the benefits gained with a DR documentation rely on a false assumption (which
we shared at the beginning of this study). It is common to think that a design
<i>has</i> a rationale. This is what makes the idea of "capture" possible. Some
authors (e.g., [12]) also promote the idea that the <i>design space </i>(i.e.,
the space of possibilities) can be analyzed by designers. All of these ideas
have some limitations, because the space of possibilities is not fixed in time.
Not only this space, which depends on the designers' background and experience,
changes according to the designers involved in a project, but it also evolves
with time (because technologies change, experience is growing, industrial
strategies are different, etc.). This is what explains why some questions were
not answered by the DR: some designers asked questions about issues, options or
criteria not taken into account during the design. For instance, "why did they
choose option X (reported in the DR) and not option Y (not handled during the
project)?" It is then obvious that such questions have no answer in the DR, but
it is also important to consider that it will never be possible to avoid such
questions. Moreover, we can anticipate that the frequency of occurrence of this
class of questions (currently 8/45) will increase, as the time goes by and
designers' culture changes. We then speculate that long-term reuse of DR should
be more problematic that short-term reuse.<p>
In considering this problem, Terveen <i>et al</i>. [14] promoted the idea of a
"living design memory". This approach consists of the creation of a design
knowledge base and a design assistant program aimed at giving advice to the
designer. The designer can accept or refuse the advice. The refused advice is
discussed during a design review. These discussions may produce further
knowledge which will be incorporated into the design knowledge base. This
living approach to the design memory, while interesting, presents two
limitations: firstly, Terveen <i>et al</i>.'s paper reports that many users
still have problems with the current system; secondly, this approach radically
changes the way designers are currently working. Designers at the design office
where our study was conducted have rejected this approach for this reason.<p>
Another possible approach exists, which acknowledges the intrinsic limitations
of any memory system and develops a social approach to design memory [1].
According to this approach, the emphasis must be on dialogue in work settings,
because it is there that people collectively (re)interpret past experience and
control others' interpretations. Putting this approach into practice means
giving the opportunity to designers to collaborate more easily and more often.
CSCW applications may be a technical solution to this problem. However, they
will not be sufficient. New work organizations must also be defined. We are
currently attempting to put these ideas into practice at Aerospatiale.<p>

Conclusion
</a></h2>
The goal of this study was to evaluate how useful DR documents are. The
analyses presented here are not sufficient to give a complete answer to this
question, in particular because we did not investigate the potential
difficulties for accessing pieces of information composing the DR. However,
given that (1) more than half of the designers' questions concern DR, and (2)
some designers extensively use the DR document as a support for understanding
and assessing a previous design, (3) less than half of the designers' DR
questions were answered with the QOC-based document, our first conclusion is
that DR documents <i>should be useful</i>, at least for the designers who want
to extensively read it, but <i>not sufficient</i>.<p>
This study highlights that traditional approaches for capturing DR exhibit some
limitations. Possible adaptations of these approaches are then necessary. In
this paper, we have considered (1) the integration of the DR with the
information currently processed by designers (in our case, this means
integrating DR with blueprints), (2) the introduction of an iterative approach
to the DR capture, going beyond the design period, and (3) the need to promote
collaboration between designers.<p>
