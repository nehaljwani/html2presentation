<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>

<P>
This paper describes a study comparing
the movement characteristics of the mouse and the velocity-control
isometric joystick. These characteristics are called the microstructure
of movement. The comparison found random variations in the velocity
of the isometric joystick that make it hard to control. The study
shows that the microstructure of movement can explain differences
in performance among devices.

performance differences

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

Since the early work by Card [2] extending
Fitts' law [6] to pointing devices, extensive research has shown
that it is a valuable tool for comparing pointing devices [9].
Fitts' law holds across a wide range of devices and conditions
[1, 3, 5, 10]. While Fitts' law is unquestionably the best available
tool to compare pointing device performance [9], it is not much
help in understanding why such differences in performance exist. <P>

For instance, a number of studies have
shown that the mouse is substantially faster than the isometric
joystick [2, 3, 5, 13]. For example, in an earlier study, we,
reported that the isometric joystick was 70% slower than the mouse
[4], but none of the studies explains the reason for the performance
difference.  <P>

A possible explanation for this is
that all these studies examine the gross characteristics of movement,
such as target width, target distance and movement time, which
are the variables in the Fitts' law equation. In doing so, they
ignore the path the cursor follows in its movement towards the
target, and so cannot describe the manner in which movement occurs.
<P>

For example, Figure 1 illustrates two
hypothetical movements. It plots the velocity towards the target
on the Y-axis, and distance from the start on the X-axis. From
the plot, we can see the speed at which the cursor was moving
at any point towards the target. Both trials have the same target
distance and width, and take the same amount of time. From the
point of view of a Fitts' law analysis, they are identical, but
they have different movement microstructures. The first trial
is made up of three submovements, all in the direction of the
target. The second trial has two submovements, the first of which
overshoots the target, and the second doubles back. <BR>

<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="akm_fg1.gif"></CENTER><BR>
Figure 1: Two trials (not to scale) which are identical from the point of
view of Fitts' law, but have different microstructures of movement.
<P>
In addition, to ignoring the structure of movement, the Fitts'
law analysis is performed by averaging the movement times for
a given target and width combination. What happens during a single
movement of the cursor towards a target is ignored both by the
type of data gathered and by the analysis technique used. As a
result, current research on pointing devices has no way to explain
why performance differences exist between pointing devices.
<P>
In building models that describe movement, psychomotor research
examines the microstructure of movement. As the cursor moves towards
the target, time and displacement data is gathered for each trial.
Velocity is then derived and plotted as a function of time as
shown in Figure 1. From this the pattern of submovements is studied.
<P>
This methodology can be used to study pointing devices as shown
in this paper. We describe here the results obtained from comparing
the movement microstructure of two devices, the mouse and the
isometric joystick. Our analysis shows that there are random variations
in the velocity of the cursor which are evident in the microstructure
of the joystick but not the mouse. These variations would make
fine control difficult with the isometric joystick. Thus differences
in performance can be attributed directly to differences observed
in their movement microstructures.

<H2>PREVIOUS RESEARCH</H2>

<P>
The mouse is the ubiquitous pointing
device. Early work [2] showed that it was very fast and had few
errors. Since then numerous studies have supported its superiority
and only the touch tablet seems to have similar performance [10].

<P>
The isometric joystick is a device that does not move when force
is applied to it, but is able to sense the applied force and translate
that into a velocity of the cursor on the screen. It has attracted
a great deal of research interest because its small size makes
it ideal for notebook computers where space is at a premium making
it popular in current PC-compatible notebook computers. 
<P>
However, research dating back to the early Card study has consistently
shown it to be slower and have more errors than the mouse. Epps
[5] and Rutledge and Selker [13] similarly found poor performance
with the joystick. Subjects in one study complained that the isometric
joystick &quot;was hard to control&quot; [4]. Thus there is ample
evidence that there is a substantial difference in performance
between mice and isometric joysticks, but the literature does
not explain why. 
<P>
There are three major differences between the mouse and the isometric
joystick that can account for differences in performance, the
isometricity of the joystick, the order of control and finger
vs. wrist control. Because the isometric joystick does not move
when pressure is applied to it, the amount of kinesthetic feedback
that the user gets is drastically reduced. [12]
<P>
The second major difference is that the joystick controls the
velocity of the cursor on the screen [12]. The harder that a user
pushes, the faster the cursor moves, like a car's accelerator.
This is referred to as first order control, while the mouse's
mapping of mouse displacement to cursor displacement is called
zero order control. Jagacinski showed that for isotonic joysticks,
displacement control is better for stationary targets, while velocity
control is better for targets moving at constant velocity [7].
These results have not been tested for isometric joysticks, possibly
because it is difficult if not impossible to construct a displacement
control isometric joystick.
<P>
In addition, most isometric joysticks in use today are controlled
by the tip of the index finger, while the mouse is controlled
by the wrist. Langolf showed that the finger had a higher Fitts'
law index of performance than the wrist, but again, he was studying
isotonic movement. Any of these differences could cause the performance
differences between the devices.
<P>
The characteristics of movement have been of interest to psychomotor
researchers for a while, and were first used in the Langolf study
[8]. The term microstructure of movement was coined by Jagacinski
in his study of isotonic joysticks [7]. Figure 1 indicates what
the microstructure might be. The upper figure shows a trial consisting
of a rapid submovement that covers most of the distance to the
target, followed by two smaller, relatively less accurate submovements.
Jagacinski's data showed that a single movement towards a target
is made up of a sequence of one or more submovements (rarely more
than three), and the first submovement tends to be much larger
and faster than the rest of the submovements.
<P>
Meyer et al. developed a model, the stochastic optimized submovement
model based on the idea that a movement is made up of submovements,
and optimizes the conflicting goals of rapid movement and low
error rates [11]. The model predicts a close approximation to
Fitts' law and also predicts that the first submovement is faster
and more accurate than the rest of the submovements. This was
verified for wrist movements, supporting Jagacinski's observations,
and subsequent research has extended this model to movement with
the mouse [15]. 
<P>
The present study gathered data on the microstructure of movement
for mouse and isometric joystick to see if the observations about
movement characteristics of the mouse were applicable to the isometric
joystick, and to see whether differences in the movement microstructure
could be used to explain differences in performance.

<H2>METHOD</H2>

This study was performed in two parts,
a pilot study to test the equipment and software, and the main
study. Data from both parts is presented here.

<H3>Subjects</H3>
For the main study there were 6 subjects,
all from the University of Oregon, volunteers who were promised
a home cooked Indian meal on completion of the study. Four subjects
were from the Computer Science department, two were staff  and
two were graduate students. The remaining two were graduate students
from the College of Business. There were two women among the subjects.
All subjects were right handed and used the pointing devices with
their preferred hand. Five of the subjects were expert mouse users
prior to the study and used a mouse every day. Similarly, two
subjects were expert with the kind of isometric joystick used
in the experiment, using it every day in their work.<P>

<H3>Equipment</H3>

The mouse used was a Microsoft Mouse
ver. 2.0, FCC ID C3KSMP1. It mapped displacement on the
mousepad to displacement on the screen using the default non-linear
display control function in the Windows NT 3.5 mouse driver. The
isometric joystick used was an IBM TrackPoint II keyboard with
embedded pointing device, shown in Figure 2. The keyboard has
an isometric joystick embedded between the 'G', 'H' and 'B' keys.
It protrudes 1 mm above the keycaps and thus does not interfere
with typing. There are two buttons below the space bar that correspond
to the two buttons on a mouse. Users control the cursor by pushing
on the joystick. The joystick maps force into the velocity of
the cursor on the screen. It picks up the magnitude and direction
of the applied force and moves the cursor correspondingly. Its
hardware uses a discontinuous non-linear display control function
that is fed to the Windows NT mouse driver [13]. 
<P>
Both devices were connected to an MS-DOS compatible 90 Mhz Pentium
running Windows NT 3.5. An MS-DOS computer has one connection
for keyboard data. A pointing device can be connected either through
a PS/2 mouse port, or through a serial port (Figure 3). The TrackPoint
keyboard has two cables that come out of it, one going to the
PS/2 keyboard port, and the other going to the PS/2 mouse port.
In addition, there is a PS/2 mouse port on the keyboard that allows
a user to attach a mouse to the keyboard for use in addition to
the TrackPoint joystick. This configuration was used in the study,
and is shown in Figure 3. <P>

<H3>Experimental Task</H3>
The experimental program presented
subjects with the screen shown in Figure 4. A trial began when
the subject clicked in the home square, and ended when the subject
clicked in the target ribbon. The time at the start of the trial
and the time at the end of the trial were recorded. In addition,
the software sampled the position of the mouse cursor between
the clicks every 16 ms, keeping track of position and time.
<P>
After the completion of a trial, the screen was blanked, and the
data from the trial was written to disk and then the next trial
was presented. If the subject missed the target, the computer
beeped, and the subjects was made to complete the trial. The trial
was marked as an error and written to the data file, and presented
again to the subject at the end of the block.<P>

<P>
The cursor was re-centered on the home
square prior to each trial, and the home square always appeared
in the same location. The width and location of the target ribbon
were varied as indicated in Table 1. These values generated the
following six amplitude to width ratios (A/W): 48, 24, 12, 6,

<H3>Experimental Design</H3>
Subjects completed the experiment in
six sessions, three with each device. Three subjects did the three
mouse sessions before the joystick sessions, and the other three
reversed the order of the experiment. Subjects were randomly assigned
to the orders. This was done to control for order effects. 
<P>
One area of concern was that the subjects on the average had more
experience with the mouse than the isometric joystick. In order
to counteract this, subjects were given a large number of trials
with each device, 600 randomly presented trials per session, or
1800 trials with each device. Earlier work indicates that after
approximately 1200 trials, subjects do not have significant improvement
in performance from one block of 120 trials to the next [2, 4].
Subjects were given 1800 trials so that the data from the last
block of 120 trials would represent practiced performance.

<H2>RESULTS</H2>

The data from the experiment was analyzed
in two ways, a gross level analysis, and a micro level analysis.
The gross level analysis helped to validate the data and examined
learning effects and did a Fitts' law analysis. In order to see
the effect of learning, the data was grouped into blocks of 120
trials, 5 per session, and 15 per device. A pair-wise <I>t</I>-test
between successive blocks showed that there was no significant
learning (p  0.5) after block 3 for the mouse and block 7 for
the joystick. Thus we can assume that by the end of the experiment
subjects were sufficiently practiced on both devices.
<P>
An analysis of the last block of 120 trials for all subjects showed
that both devices followed Fitts' law, with an r<SUP>2</SUP> of
.998 for the mouse, .991 for the joystick, and IP of 8.13 for
the mouse, and 5.75 for the joystick. 

<H3>Movement Microstructure for the Mouse</H3>

The second part of the analysis was
of the movement microstructure for each device. Figure 5 represents
a single trial from the pilot study, with the time in milliseconds
on the x-axis, and distance from the start on the first y-axis.
This curve is difficult to interpret, and is generally not used
for analysis. Velocity is plotted on the second y-axis and provides
more information. We can see how the velocity varied over the
duration of the trial. There was almost no movement for 200 milliseconds,
which corresponds well to the reaction time found in other studies
[2]. There was then a large, rapid submovement, followed by a
two smaller submovements. The first of these overshot the target
(which was at 768 pixels), and the second was a corrective submovement
that moved back to the target. <P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="akm_fg6.gif"></CENTER><BR>
Figure 6. PS/2 mouse trial with
velocity as a function of distance. A = 768 pixels. <P>

A better way of looking at these data
is shown in Figure 6, with displacement on the x-axis, and velocity
on the y-axis. From this graph, we can see the speed of the cursor
at any point along the path to the target. This graph shows that
the movement is a sequence of three submovements. The first submovement
covers most of the distance to the target and reaches a high peak
velocity. The next two submovements are smaller, covering smaller
proportions of the distance to the target. The second submovement
overshot the target and the third submovement was a correction,
bringing the cursor back to the target. <P>

The plot in Figure 6 is a prototypical trial, that supports earlier
findings that the first submovement tends to be larger and faster
than the subsequent submovements. It is representative of the
data obtained for a number of different types of mice in the pilot
study, as well as in the data from the main study.  <P>

Mouse data from the main study was similar. Figure 7 and  Figure 8
represent mouse movement data from the main experiment. They trials
have been selected because they are representative of mouse trials
from the main study.  <P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="akm_fg8.gif"></CENTER><BR>

Figure 7 shows that the subject made
a rapid primary submovement towards the target that overshot.
The subject doubled back with the second submovement and overshot
again. The third submovement also overshot, and the subject oscillated
around the target till it was reached. This trial also has a large
primary submovement, followed by smaller secondary submovements.
Figure 8 deviates from the prototype in that there appear to be
two large movements followed by smaller movements. <P>

These figures show that in general,
mouse movements have a large primary submovement, followed by
smaller submovements, which is consistent with the data from earlier
studies. This characteristic held throughout the experiment, from
the early trials to the end of the study, and across all subjects.
Note that each graph has been picked out of 3600 such graphs of
mouse movement for each session. (Each of 6 subjects did 600 trials
per session, and only one graph from each session has been shown.)

<H3>Movement Microstructure for the Isometric Joystick</H3>

Data for the isometric joystick was
also obtained both pilot and main studies, and revealed an unexpected
characteristic. <P>

Figure 9 and Figure 10 show a joystick trial from the pilot study.
The distance vs. time sub-plot in Figure 9 does not reveal anything
out of the ordinary, but the velocity vs. time sub-plot shows
a strange pattern of jitter in the velocity. <P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="akm_fg9.gif"></CENTER><BR>
Figure 9. Isometric joystick - trial from preliminary tests. A = 768 pixels. <P>

This jitter is more clearly evident
when the velocity vs. distance plot (Figure 10) is examined. The
jitter appeared in all the isometric joystick trials. This particular
trial was one of the first attempted by the test subject, but
persisted after 50 trials, and also occurred in trials by others. <P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="akm_fg5.gif"></CENTER><BR>
Figure 10. Isometric joystick preliminary
 tests. (Same trial as Figure 9.)  A = 768 pixels. <P>

There are a number of things that could
account for this jitter. Among other things, it could be caused
by an interaction between the joystick and the computer, it could
be an artifact of the program gathering the data, it could be
the subject, and it could be caused by the computer.  <P>

To eliminate the possibility that the error was caused by an interaction
between the computer and the joystick, the TrackPoint keyboard
was connected to another computer, with the same result, i.e.,
the jitter was still present.  <P>

Figure 3 showed the different ways in which pointing devices can
be connected to MS-DOS computers. To eliminate the possibility
that the jitter was due to the PS/2 connection used by the isometric
joystick, tests were performed with four different pointing device
configurations with the TrackPoint keyboard or a separate keyboard
as appropriate. These configurations were the TrackPoint keyboard
by itself, the PS/2 mouse by itself, the PS/2 mouse connected
through the TrackPoint's PS/2 port, and an identical RS-232c serial
mouse. In all cases, graphs for the mouse did not show jitter,
with graphs similar to Figure 6, and jitter was present in the
TrackPoint joystick. <P>

To eliminate the possibility that there was a flaw in this particular
joystick, the software was recompiled to run on a smaller screen
(640x480, the standard size for notebook computers), and the test
carried out on two IBM ThinkPads (which have built-in TrackPoints)
and on an NEC Versa notebook (that has a similar isometric joystick,
but is not called a TrackPoint), and the tremor was still present. <P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="akm_fg11.gif"></CENTER><BR>
Figure 11. PortaPoint trial showing jitter. A = 768 pixels. <P>

The last isometric device tested was
a PortaPoint. It  is a separate isometric joystick that uses the
same electronics that are used in the Home Row 'J' mouse keyboard
[4, 3]. The PortaPoint is mounted in a housing similar in shape
to a mouse, and attaches to the computer through the PS/2 mouse
port. Figure 11 is a trial from this device, showing jitter. <P>

In all the tests conducted, none of
the mouse configurations showed jitter, and all of the isometric
joystick configurations showed jitter. If we go back to the base
condition, the PS/2 mouse, by being connected to the TrackPoint's
PS/2 connector, feeds data to the CPU through the same cable to
the same software. Therefore there is something about the isometric
joystick that causes the jitter. <P>

After carefully considering all possible sources that could cause
this jerkiness, the only explanation we found that fit all the
available data was that the isometric joystick, which is force
sensitive, was picking up physiological tremor in the finger.
Tremor is a series of random variations in force that occur in
the finger (and the rest of the human body), and the isometric
joystick translates these changes into variations in cursor velocity.
Tremor occurs during the application of force, during steady movement,
and even at rest. It tends to increase with increased force [14].<P>

The effect of tremor on the joystick's movement microstructure
was a totally unexpected phenomenon. When the main study was conducted,
jitter continued to be evident in joystick trials throughout the
experiment.
<P>
The graphs shown in Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14 are representative
samples of joystick trials from the main study. Figure 12 shows
that the movement towards the target was made up of a sequence
of movements that had rapidly changing velocity. Figure 13 shows
a period in the beginning of the movement which might represent
a primary submovement with rapid movement towards the target,
relatively unaffected by tremor. The rest of the movement is quite
badly obscured by tremor. <P>

<P>

Joystick trials were thus characterized
by jerkiness that is visible only when the velocity of the trial
is studied either over time or over movement distance. The jerkiness
was evident in early trials in the pilot study and persisted throughout
the duration of the main study.

The presence of the jitter in the isometric
joystick trials suggests higher frequency components in joystick
trials than mouse trials. This was verified through spectral analysis.
Figure 15 presents the frequency data for the mouse for all subjects
compared to the frequency data for the joystick all subjects.
It clearly shows a that there is a greater percentage of the power
for higher frequencies (between 3 and 10 Hz) for the joystick
than for the mouse, which is consistent with higher frequencies
in the jitter.

<H2>DISCUSSION</H2>

<H3>Tremor and the Isometric Joystick</H3>

The jerkiness in the velocity domain
did not appear either in the analyses of mouse movement, nor in
plots of cursor position vs. time for the joystick. But when the
velocity of the joystick was plotted, either against time or against
distance, the jitter leapt out. On reflection, this is not surprising.<P>

Consider Figure 16 which shows a block diagram of an isometric
joystick. The joystick is a force sensitive device that translates
input force into changes in cursor velocity. Note that because
the joystick is using the same hardware connections and software
drivers as the mouse, it must send data to the OS in the same
form as the mouse. The mouse sends the OS data about displacement,
and so the isometric joystick performs an integration of velocity
over time in order to send similar displacement information. <P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="akm_fg16.gif"></CENTER><BR>
Figure 16. Block diagram of isometric joystick. <P>

When there is tremor present in the
finger, the tremor is perceived as changes in applied force. These
in turn are mapped onto changes in velocity which of course get
integrated into displacements and sent to the OS. As long as we
look at plots of displacement, nothing is apparent. The moment
we look at plots in the velocity domain, the tremor appears.  <P>

The isometric joystick happens to be unique in the manner in which
it picks up tremor and the way in which it is affected by it.
Consider for a moment the finger that controls the joystick. It
is applying a lateral force on the joystick, and it is unsupported.
It also does not move. Therefore there is little to damp the tremor.
In other types of movement, tremor is damped by two things, inertial
mass and friction. Because the finger does not move, inertial
mass does not play a role and so does not damp tremor. Again,
because nothing moves, friction does not play a role. In fact,
the only damping factor that we have been able to uncover is the
friction that exists between adjacent muscle fibers in the finger
[14].
<P>
Tremor also occurs during mouse movement, but it does not have
the same effect for two reasons. First, the mouse operates in
the displacement domain, and is not sensitive to changes in applied
force in the manner that the joystick is. It responds only to
changes in displacement. The mouse is therefore not directly affected
by tremor. Second, when a mouse is moving across a mousepad, any
tremor is damped by the friction of the mouse and the hand on
the mousepad, as well as by the mass of the hand, wrist and mouse
(and perhaps the forearm). Due to these reasons, tremor does not
appear in plots of mouse movement. So the physical construction
of the joystick makes it susceptible to tremor in a manner that
devices such as the mouse are not.
<P>
The effect of tremor on other pointing devices is still an open
question. Two devices that use relatively unsupported limbs are
the trackball and the touch tablet. The trackball is typically
controlled by a single thumb or single finger, while touch tablets
are controlled either by a finger, or by a stylus. While inertial
mass and friction still play a role in these devices, the lack
of support for the controlling limb suggests that a similar study
needs to be performed on these devices to determine how they are
affected by tremor. 
<P>
The joystick also accentuates tremor. This tremor is picked up
by the joystick and passed on to the joystick's hardware controller.
The joystick's controller employs an 'accelerated' design, i.e.
it employs a non-linear translation between input force and output
displacement. This transfer function accentuates the effect that
changes in input have on the output. So the changes caused by
tremor are exaggerated in the displacement data that is sent to
the software driver. The software driver is in turn accelerated,
and accentuates changes in displacement into larger changes in
the position of the cursor. The net result is that the velocity
of the cursor varies widely as it moves across the screen. Thus
the design of the joystick makes it unique in the way that it
amplifies tremor.
<P>
The effect of tremor might be reduced by introducing digital signal
processing routines into the joystick's hardware or in its software
drivers. These routines could filter out the tremor. Making the
joystick slightly deformable might introduce enough inertia into
the system to damp the tremor. Additionally, a support for the
finger might also reduce tremor.
<P>
To summarize, studying the movement microstructure for the joystick
revealed that tremor causes involuntary changes in cursor velocity.
Taking a closer look at the characteristics of the joystick and
its connections to the computer showed that the isometric joystick
is unique in the way that it is affected by tremor and the way
in which it accentuates the effects of tremor. 

<H2>CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER RESEARCH
</H2>

The study leads to a number of conclusions:
about the effect of tremor on controlling pointing devices, about
the value of the microstructure level analysis, and about the
importance of examining the variable being controlled.

<H3>Tremor Makes Isometric Devices Difficult to Control</H3>

During an earlier study with a finger-controlled
isometric joystick [4], subjects were interviewed to get qualitative
feedback from them about their experience. A surprisingly large
number of them said that they had a lot of trouble getting the
joystick to stop in small targets (the smallest target was 8 pixels
across).  <P>

The reason for this is now easy to
understand. Tremor causes involuntary changes  in the velocity
at which the cursor moves. This makes it difficult for users to
achieve fine control over the cursor making it difficult to stop
the cursor at a desired point on the screen and explains why isometric
joysticks are hard to control. 

<H3>The Need to Examine the Variable Being Controlled</H3>

<P>
A simple lesson from this study is
that when a pointing device is being studied, we need to examine
its effect on the variable it controls. The isometric joystick
controls the velocity of the cursor (even though it integrates
the velocity over time and sends the computer displacement information).
The effect of tremor was visible only when velocity was plotted
against time or displacement. 
<P>
Taking this argument to the next stage, the implication is that
we should look at graphs of the appropriate variable. For example,
if we control acceleration, we should look at graphs of acceleration.

<H3>Future Research</H3>

<P>
This study opened avenues of additional
research, some of which has been completed and is outside the
scope of this paper. A more extensive Fourier analysis has been
completed, which revealed patterns of individual differences and
learning. One of our originals goal was to model movement with
the isometric joystick, but we were confounded by the problems
that we were unable to differentiate voluntary from involuntary
submovements in the case of the isometric joystick. We believe
that studying muscle activations and neuron firings will help
in this area. While our goal was understanding movement with the
isometric joystick, our study has suggested ways in which it can
be improved. These improvements have to be incorporated and tested.
<H2>The Microstructure Level Analysis
as a Research Tool</H2>

<P>
The microstructure level analysis was
extremely effective in providing information about what happened
during joystick trials. The next step in the development of research
on pointing devices should be to study movement microstructure
in the manner that a Fitts' law analysis is routinely done. The
manner in which this study uncovered tremor in the isometric devices
strongly supports this suggestion. 
<P>
Fitts' law, which is the tool most often used in understanding
pointing devices, is excellent for comparing devices, but does
not help explain why some devices perform better than others.
The study of the microstructure of movement of a device helps
explain device performance. 
<P>
We need inventories of knowledge of the microstructure of movement
with different devices just like we have a corpus of knowledge
about gross movement and the applicability of Fitts' law. 
<P>
Research on pointing devices will feed off research on the human
psychomotor system, and is likely provide an impetus for new discoveries
about how humans move. In this effort, Fitts' law must be augmented
by microstructure level analysis as the primary research and design
tool for pointing devices [9]. This work is the first step in
that direction.
