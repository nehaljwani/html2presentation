<h4>ABSTRACT</h4><p>
<i>If Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) systems are to be
successful over time, it will be necessary to promote ongoing and continuing
activity, not just initial adoption.  In this paper, we consider what technical
and social affordances are required to encourage the continued use of a CSCW
system.<p>
To explore these issues, we examine a chat-like system, the Zephyr Help
Instance, which is used extensively at MIT.  The Help Instance facilitates
users asking questions of one another, and is an example of a distributed help
and problem-solving system.  We provide an overview of the system's use as well
as those mechanisms, both technical and social, that facilitate continuing its
use over time.   <p>

<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4><p>
<p>
<ul>
Worlds are socially constructed and socially maintained.  Their continuing
reality... depends on specific social processes, namely those processes that
ongoingly reconstruct and maintain the particular worlds in question.  (Berger
[2], p. 45)<p>
</ul>
If Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) systems are to be successful, it
will be necessary to promote ongoing, continuing activity.  Even once a CSCW
system gets past the critical mass problem, users must continue to find it not
only useful, but usable.  Only some CSCW systems will provide the social and
technical affordances necessary to promote the social maintenance required for
continued use.  <p>
We examine this issue through the study of a particular system, the Zephyr Help
Instance, at MIT.  The Zephyr Help Instance is a chat-like system that allows
users to ask questions and other users to answer.  The Zephyr Help Instance
serves as an interesting field study site for several reasons:
<ul>
<li>    Zephyr is a successful CSCW system in production use.  </ul>At CSCW'94, a
call was made to find "real" CSCW systems in wide-scale use.  The Zephyr Help
Instance has been in heavy use for 7 years (at over 30,000 messages per
semester).  In its organizational setting, this computer-mediated communication
(CMC) system is not monitored or maintained by any authority; its existence is
sustained and organized solely by its users.  Because its use is discretionary,
it serves as an excellent opportunity to study how users might organize their
electronic social space.
<ul>
<li>    Zephyr ameliorates an important help problem by providing a mechanism for
distributed help and problem-solving.  It does this by allowing users to help
one another.  </ul>Relatively little is known about how people can best assist
one another in a computationally distributed environment.  With the Zephyr Help
Instance, users help one another in a cooperative environment to continue their
work tasks.  There have been many times, some highlighted below, where no
single person could answer the question posed, but a group of people could.  Of
course, this type of help would be of little value if the system were not an
ongoing source of answers.<p>
<ul>
<li>    Zephyr has a simple user interface, making it easier to determine the
interaction of system affordances and social maintenance.</ul>Zephyr is a bit
of a paradox.  The standard interface is rudimentary, consisting of either a
text-based, tty interface or a simple X-based interface.  Yet, the system
<i>is</i> used extensively for technical problem-solving, as well as other
types of work and social communication.  The simplicity of the user interface
allows us to more easily see the social affordances.  It is our contention that
the system allows participants to invoke a rich set of social behaviors and
adaptations.  Not only do these interactions allow them to problem-solve, it
also allows them to maintain and organize their electronic social space.  This
usability capability is partially dependent on the user interface, as normally
construed, and partially on the organizational or external interface [14]. <p>
Therefore, this system provides an interesting and important study.  Simply
put, the Zephyr Help Instance highlights some critical CSCW requirements --
requirements that have enabled it to be a success within its environment of use
<i>over time.</i>  <p>
We begin the paper with a brief examination of the CSCW literature concerning
continued use over time.  Following this, we describe Zephyr in general and the
Help Instance in particular.  With a firm base in the use of the system, we
then analyze why the Zephyr Help Instance has continued to be used.  <p>
<h4>CSCW SYSTEMS AND ONGOING ACTIVITY</h4><p>
Numerous CSCW and information technology studies have examined the
adoption of group and organizational systems (e.g., [9]).  The social impacts
of computational systems have also been heavily studied (e.g., [16]).  <p>
Determining the conditions of success and continuation has been much less
clear.  One strand of research argues that within many organizations, where use
may be mandated, continued use is dependent primarily on either coercion or
user satisfaction.  The studies assume that with high user satisfaction,
systems will be effectively used.  Many user involvement and participatory
design studies fall within this research stream.<p>
Another line of argument assumes that fit to the social situation provides for
system success (or failure) over the long run.  In her study of Lotus Notes,
Orlikowski [15] claimed that the system assumptions cannot be contrary to the
reward schemes and mental maps of the organization or of key groups.  Bowers
[3] came to similar conclusions in his study of a British government office.
Both Orlikowski and Bowers acknowledge the necessity of organizational fit, but
also paint a considerably more complex picture that requires a consideration of
individuals' goals, shared understandings, and system affordances.
Unfortunately, both studied implementations that were failures at the time of
study, swaying their conclusions.<p>
While there are few field-based studies of continuing use of computational
systems, to our knowledge, there are no studies examining how CMC-based help
systems maintain themselves over time.  Help has been extensively studied:
There is a plethora of studies of technical systems (e.g., [4]), help
information design (e.g., [13]), and face-to-face interactions between users
and expert consultants (e.g., [1]).  Nonetheless, while CMCs have considerable
potential for providing access to distributed colleagues for help and problem
solving, there is mostly anecdotal evidence for this capability.  Sproull and
Kiesler do report on a number of CMC uses, including the norms of use, in [17].
Similarly, Finholt reported on the use of distribution lists and their archives
in [7].  Outside of these studies, little attention has been paid to how groups
using CMCs (particularly for help) organize themselves to maintain their social
spaces.  <p>
<h4>ZEPHYR MESSAGE SYSTEM AT MIT</h4><p>
The Zephyr system is a synchronous chat facility supported on
MIT/Project Athena workstations [6].  In Athena, users can use any
public-access workstation in any location.  Zephyr provides a synchronous
method of both communicating and finding other people in a geographically and
computationally distributed environment.<p>
Zephyr messages can be sent to a channel, called an "instance", to which
multiple people are subscribed.  Messages can also be sent to individuals or
groups of individuals.  (We are omitting description of some advanced features
from our discussion here.)  Sending a message to an instance is the equivalent
of participating in a chat channel; the message is sent to all the people who
are subscribing to the instance at that time.  <p>
<h4>Methods and data</h4><p>
The analysis presented here was largely based on a qualitative
examination of the publicly-available message log for one semester, Autumn,
1993.  The log consists of 30,052 messages, providing data for 93 days of the
105-day semester.  There are gaps of 9 days and of 4 days because of failures
in the logging mechanism.  There are also some days with only partial data,
although it is often difficult to determine when Zephyr was inactive, the
logging application was broken, or the Athena system was down.  <p>
In addition to our analysis of the message log, the first author has been a
participant-observer on the system for approximately three years (and a casual
participant for much longer).  We have also interviewed the people that started
the Help Instance, and interviewed a small number of heavy and light users.  We
conducted 19 interviews in total.  We have used this additional data to
corroborate and inform our analysis.<p>
The analysis followed qualitative techniques standardly used to examine
small-scale interactions (as in [12]).  We were careful to triangulate among
our data.<p>
<h4>Users</h4><p>
Help Instance users are entirely MIT affiliates, mostly  undergraduates,
since they are the typical Athena user.  This does provide a different type of
user population than in many organizations.  For example, undergraduates have
more time and more willingness to engage new technologies.  Additionally, MIT
has a distinct technical culture.  On the other hand, MIT undergraduates have a
wide diversity of technical competence and interest.  In general, we believe
that the Zephyr users are typical of many technical users, but we will discuss
the impact of MIT as an organizational culture below.<p>
In Autumn, 1993, there were 540 users.  Usage followed the familiar exponential
curve of CMCs [10].  It is important to note that there were a number of user
groups.  Based on our analyses of the message log, it is clear that there was a
core group of "regulars" on the Help Instance (approximately 8% of users).
Some people lived on the system.  One user had nearly 2400 messages on the Help
Instance alone.  There was also an intermediate group of intermittent users
(the middle of the exponential curve), who participated over the extent of the
quarter but at a lower level.  Some appeared to stay subscribed to the Help
Instance but participated at a lower level; others may have subscribed when
they wanted to ask a question or had the time to answer.  There were a large
number of users (39%) who sent four or fewer messages.  Our interview data
suggest that the tire-kickers (the tail of the curve) subscribed only when they
wanted to ask a question.<p>
Although we have interview and observation evidence that person-to-person
exchanges are more common than broadcasting to public instances, we are
emphasizing one particular chat channel, the Help Instance, in this paper.  It
should be noted that the Help Instance is only one channel on the system.
Still, the Help Instance was enormously popular and useful.<p>
<h4>Zephyr in use</h4><p>
The following sections show how Zephyr is used.  Before discussing the
technical and social mechanisms by which the Help Instance continues over time
as a social space, we need to ground that discussion by describing what occurs
on the system.  <p>
In the following two message exchange, the user named <tt>azir</tt> asks a
question, and <tt>clee</tt> answers it.  (All names and other identifiers have
been changed in any data presented here.  Additionally, we have modified the
headers and messages slightly for readability and because of page
constraints.)<p>
<tt>Time: 18:57:10 Date: Fri Oct 29 1993 </tt><br>
<tt>From: @times(@b(@i( Course II ))) &lt;azir&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>after i change a list to a group, how long</tt><br>
<tt>before i can use it?</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt>Time: 18:57:52 Date: Fri Oct 29 1993</tt><br>
<tt>From: starlight on a moonless night &lt;clee&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>you can use it immediately</tt><br>
<tt><i></i></tt><br>
<tt><i></i></tt>The rapidity and burstiness of interaction are impossible to
duplicate in print, but long lulls are punctuated with frantic bursts of
activity.  That these messages are only 42 seconds apart is normal.  This
pacing gives the system a flavor very different from net news or e-mail.  <p>
The pace of query and response is an extremely important feature of the system.
Messages fly by.  If they are not answered within a few minutes, it is likely
that they never will be.  In general, users ignore any older messages; the
system is effectively memoryless.  <p>
Several additional things about the messages should be noted.  First, the
example messages above are unusually short, but the available editors as well
as the rapidity of the exchanges tend to keep messages below 10 lines long.
All of the lines arrive together.  Second, the user must keep track of the
conversational threads to know how a message fits into potentially many
simultaneous exchanges.  <p>
Third, there is some identifying information in addition to the message itself.
The timestamp, originating machine, and user id are provided by the system and
guaranteed to be correct.  The signature on the From line, however, is set by
the user.  These signatures, or "zsigs", are extremely interesting in their own
right.  Unfortunately, the zsigs have been shortened here because of space
constraints.  Finally, the messages are simple in format and flexible in
structure.  As can be noted from the first From line, there are markup codes
for fonts, font styles, and color.  (The formatting appears as only markup
commands on the tty interface.)  There are no other embellishments to the
messages.<p>
As mentioned, the user interface for Zephyr is rudimentary.  Incoming messages
pop up on the user's X screen or scroll by in a tty window; outgoing messages
are written with a line-oriented editor.  More sophisticated interfaces exist,
but are seldom used.  <p>
<h4>Distributed use of the Help Instance</h4><p>
Many exchanges are like the one presented above -- a single question
followed by a single answer.  However, one of the advantages of distributed
problem solving is that a community of people is involved and many people can
attend to each question.  Some of the most interesting interactions on the Help
Instance capitalize on its distributed nature; these interactions occur when an
answer could not be readily provided, and it takes several people multiple
iterations to arrive at a solution.  Below is an exchange where one person adds
to the answer of another:<p>
<tt>Time: 20:48:09 Date: Fri Oct 29 1993 </tt><br>
<tt>From: @i[@(blue)Faded] &lt;chatter&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>Thanks for helping me before, but now I have </tt><br>
<tt>another problem.</tt><br>
<tt>I'm trying to use ftp.</tt><br>
<tt>I've gotten into another schools files, but </tt><br>
<tt>how do you open them</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt>Time: 20:48:38 Date: Fri Oct 29 1993 </tt><br>
<tt>From: The Ranger &lt;ranger&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>get filename</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt>Time: 20:49:25 Date: Fri Oct 29 1993</tt><br>
<tt>From: @tt{@i{The next zsig lies.}} &lt;phopkins&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>that copies the file into your current directory</tt><br>
<tt>"man ftp" at an athena prompt for more info</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt>Time: 20:49:57 Date: Fri Oct 29 1993</tt><br>
<tt>From: @i[@color (blue)Faded] &lt;chatter&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>Thanks again!</tt><br>
<tt><i></i></tt><br>
<tt><i></i></tt>In this situation, <tt>chatter</tt> has asked a question about
getting files from another site.  <tt>ranger</tt> answers succinctly but his
answer "corrects" the naively formed question by <tt>chatter</tt>. <tt>
ranger</tt>'s answer tells <tt>chatter</tt> how to retrieve files, but not to
open them as <tt>chatter</tt> asks, because that cannot be done with ftp.
After the time for a conversational turn for <tt>chatter</tt> has elapsed,
<tt>phopkins</tt> decides to add more information that elaborates on<tt>
ranger</tt>'s answer and provides more help for a novice's use of ftp.
Finally, <tt>chatter</tt> thanks everyone for the help.<p>
The CMC nature of the Help Instance also allows corrections and modifications
where necessary.  In the following exchange, <tt>rpt</tt> corrects the initial
response.  <p>
<tt>Time: 06:27:32 Date: Thu Oct 14 93</tt><br>
<tt>From: Health is merely the slowest possible </tt><br>
<tt>rate at which one can die. &lt;elf&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>Who wrote "Hallelujah!"?  Or is the author </tt><br>
<tt>unknown?</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt>Time: 06:28:27 Date: Thu Oct 14 93</tt><br>
<tt>From: band-aid &lt;johnson&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>If you're speaking of the Halleljuah chorus,</tt><br>

<tt>From: Robert Talbott &lt;rpt&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>Handel, not Hayden</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt></tt>In addition to multi-party answers, the chat-like nature of the Help
Instance allows a user to ask for additional help if he doesn't understand the
answer:<p>
<tt>Time: 15:44:28 Date: Fri Oct 29 1993 </tt><br>
<tt>From: Snoozin' &lt;felly&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>Why is a load average made up of three </tt><br>
<tt>numbers?  What do the numbers mean?</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt>Time: 15:45:24 Date: Fri Oct 29 1993 </tt><br>
<tt>From: Redhead at the wheel &lt;kat&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>I think they are short, medium, and long-</tt><br>
<tt>term numbers, but I'm not sure.  I think they </tt><br>
<tt>mean nothing, but I'm not sure</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt>Time: 15:46:05 Date: Fri Oct 29 1993 </tt><br>
<tt>From: Mythical man-month at work &lt;dan&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>1 5 15</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt>Time: 15:46:35 Date: Fri Oct 29 1993 </tt><br>
<tt>From: Snoozin' &lt;felly&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>Huh?</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt>Time: 15:47:07 Date: Fri Oct 29 1993 </tt><br>
<tt>From: Synthetic syntax spoken &lt;descartes&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>Load averaged over the last 1, 5, and 15 </tt><br>
<tt>minutes,<i> </i>respectively </tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>

In this example, user <tt>felly</tt> posted a question; <tt>kat</tt>
gave a partial response.  Another user <tt>dan</tt> gave a different
partial response, perhaps in an effort to disambiguate <tt>kat</tt>'s.
Yet another user, <tt>descartes</tt>, gave the final correct answer
which disambiguated the previous partial responses. While <tt>kat</tt>
made the initial effort to help <tt>felly</tt>, both <tt>dan</tt> and
<tt>descartes</tt> joined the conversation in an attempt to make the
answer as precise and helpful as possible.  This example is one kind
of collaborative interaction that illustrates the distributed
problem-solving that takes place on the Help Instance.  More complex
problem-solving also takes place, with extensive iteration and
negotiation among users to understand and define the problem.<p>

Finally, many questions get posted that never receive an answer, while others
receive responses from many people at once.  While this appears to be a failure
of the system, it is expected by users.  Realizing that one might not get an
answer is actually very important to the sustained functioning of the system.
Additionally, some questions get a single response referring to a place where a
"stock" answer or other information resources can be found.  <p>
To summarize, the Zephyr Help Instance provides a mechanism by which users can
answer one another's questions.  They do this in a distributed environment, and
many people can listen and participate in the exchanges.  Because participation
is always discretionary, users can answer, modify answers, or correct mistakes
as they wish.  Furthermore, many users can simultaneously participate to solve
complex problems.  The pace of the system provides immediate feedback and
response.<p>
The system capabilities must be augmented by social mechanisms for the system
to actually work.  For example, the synchroneity of Zephyr promotes use when
urgency matters, but a human consultant is not available.  However, there must
also be enough people on the system to hear the request.  The next section
examines the social conditions of use.<p>
<h4>WHY ZEPHYR CONTINUES TO WORK</h4><p>
Technically, Zephyr and its Help Instance are relatively simple.  What
makes the Help Instance interesting is not its technical capabilities, but that
it works so successfully.  Its viability is partially dependent on its
technical affordances for social use and partially on the social mechanisms in
place for maintaining the sociality.  We will discuss those social mechanisms
in the following sections.<p>
<h4>A shared understanding of the purpose</h4><p>
The Help Instance was begun purposefully as a forum for user questions.
It was begun in 1988 by a small group of technically expert undergraduates who
were willing to answer questions, and it has maintained the same basic format
since.<p>
The Help Instance is now a well-known and well-defined place to ask questions
and provide answers within the MIT community.  The regularity of activity
reinforces that same activity [8].  On the Help Instance, asking questions and
finding answers reinforces the actors' providing questions and answers in the
same location.  Indeed, the actors would be disconcerted if they came to the
Help Instance, and it did not contain questions and answers.  <p>
Social policing removes wildly deviant behavior on the Help Instance.  This is
made possible by a system affordance.  Because Zephyr has a number of
channels--and even more can be created dynamically by any user--it is easy to
take an exchange off the Help Instance and continue to exchange Zephyr messages
elsewhere.  In fact, the Help.d Instance provides an established forum for
discussing opinions, analyzing previous help responses, or flaming.  Users
often tell people to take a dialog to the discussion channel:<p>
<tt>Time: 14:32:17 Date: Fri Nov 19 1993</tt><br>
<tt>From: Mike &lt;mavedon&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>I can go faster not having to take my hands </tt><br>
<tt>off the keybd to operate a mouse.  also, mousing</tt><br>
<tt>bothers my wrist more than typing..</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt>Time: 14:33:15 Date: Fri Nov 19 1993</tt><br>
<tt>From: Andrew Topper &lt;andrew&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>then use xrn, and stop flaming.</tt><br>
<tt>the nature of this sort of thing is that there </tt><br>
<tt>*cannot* be One Perfect Interface For Everyone.</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt>Time: 14:32:37 Date: Fri Nov 19 1993</tt><br>
<tt>From: Mike &lt;mavedon&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>(and this should really go to help.d) </tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt></tt>They also reinforce that users should stick to the proper content for
a channel:<p>
<tt>Time: 21:20:24 Date: Fri Oct 29 1993</tt><br>
<tt>From: I'd explain it, but there's a </tt><br>
<tt>lot of math. &lt;susan&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>please, stick to the appropriate instance, </tt><br>
<tt>chang, we're on help.d</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt></tt>Like all the norms discussed here, the playing out of this norm is
dependent on the situational context and on the players involved [18].  Flames
and opinions do exist; users complain about print quotas, compilers, and their
workloads.  Still, the content of the Help Instance is remarkably consistent.
There is a "common-enough" understanding of the space's purpose.<p>
<h4>Roles of asker and answerer</h4><p>
The Help Instance, as a sociality, must reinforce the desire of people
to ask questions and for people to answer.  While there are many potential
questioners, users will not come to the Help Instance unless they can expect
their questions to be answered in a manner that is not psychologically or
socially problematic.  Likewise, potential answerers must find it socially or
psychologically beneficial to expend the time and effort to answer questions.
<p>
If the system use is to be stable, the creation of potential benefits and the
removal of potential liabilities for both questioners and answerers must be
institutionalized through some norms and roles.  In this, we follow Strauss
that these roles will not be extensively and consciously elaborated, and they
are partially dependent on the specifics of the participants [18].<p>
For the Help Instance participants, there appear to be two active roles, that
of asker and that of answerer.  The role of asker is more elaborated in that
there is a recognition that users progress from "frosh" (freshman) to more
expert users, and this progression should be accounted for in potential
answers.  <p>
These two roles are heavily intertwined with the attribute of "cluefulness",
where people range along a continuum of "clueless" (e.g., freshmen and other
naive questioners) to "clueful" or "clued" (e.g., those who answer well).  This
attribute of "cluefulness" is deeply rooted in the MIT culture, but is often
found in technical organizations.  It is most often associated with a level of
technical expertise and understanding, but it also connotes an internalization
of specific institutional and professional norms such as deference to expert
authority.  We will remark on those aspects "cluefulness" that are important to
Zephyr use in our discussion below.<p>
Socially, these two roles -- asker and answerer -- reinforce each other.
Indeed, it is important to remember that participants move fluidly between the
two.  Because of the link to "cluefulness", the roles are also socially
reinforced by and are socially reinforcing with the organizational culture of
MIT.  This process of reinforcement is key to the system's success.  However,
system affordances make the reinforcements visible and possible. <p>
In the following two sections, we discuss these roles, their norms, and the
resulting reinforcements.  We will then be able to discuss the system
affordances that enable these social mechanisms.  <p>
<h4>Reducing burden:  the role of asker </h4><p>
The information seeker creates a tension within the Help Instance.  The
purpose of the Help Instance is to provide answers; however, this will be
continued only if any burden on the answerers is minimal.  Since reciprocity
(i.e., the returning an item of similar value) cannot always be met, this need
often gets expressed through demands that the asker take the proper actions to
seek out the answer through other means:<p>

<tt>From: That is not my beautiful house. &lt;bsutton&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>*you* I expect to read the manpage when you're</tt><br>
<tt> dealing with something you don't know.</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt></tt>This requirement to exhaust other information sources before coming to
the Help Instance is not always invoked.  It is not invoked for "regulars" of
the system, perhaps because they have been presumed to have searched or because
they will reciprocally provide other information.  <p>
Even when this norm is invoked, it is most often invoked gently.  The following
exchange provides an example.  A freshman, <tt>diamond</tt>, wants to know how
to use uuencode, a program that produces ascii output from binary data.  This
program is a fairly common application, and on-line help exists in several
forms.  Two users, <tt>arno</tt> and <tt>chang</tt>, tell him to consult
external sources.  <tt>shasha</tt> tells him, unusually, to "rtfm", or to read
the manuals.  Shortly afterwards, however, <tt>chang</tt> also gives him the
answer.  In this manner, <tt>diamond</tt> gets his answer but is also provided
with a sharp reminder to check other sources first.  He is not told to go away,
but neither is his behavior completely tolerated:<p>

<tt></tt><br>
<tt></tt>Another part of being "clueful" is knowing how to phrase a question
satisfactorily.  This is something that users have to learn, since Zephyr
messages are relatively short.  In an exchange too long to reproduce here, a
freshman regarded publicly as a "clueless frosh" has been told to seek out one
of the experts for a face-to-face tutorial.  He asks whether it is really
necessary, given the lateness of the hour.  <tt>cmkao</tt> comes back with:<p>
<tt>Time: 02:02:01 Date: Sat Nov  6 1993</tt><br>
<tt>From: Familiar Assonance &lt;cmkao&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>Yes, but stop asking</tt><br>
<tt>us questions that we're getting frustrated</tt><br>
<tt>with in that case :-)</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt></tt>The freshman asks why this is a problem repeatedly.  Finally,
<tt>bsutton</tt> informs him:<p>
<tt>Time: 02:03:27 Date: Sat Nov  6 1993</tt><br>
<tt>From: Psycho killer, anyone? &lt;bsutton&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>because, bluntly, you don't know enough</tt><br>
<tt>to ask meaningfull questions or</tt><br>
<tt>to realize why we can't give you answers </tt><br>
<tt>when you ignore our questions to you</tt><br>
<tt>or even to understand that you don't know </tt><br>
<tt>some things and can't ignore some things.</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt></tt>Of course, the role of the information seeker requires the
complementary role of information provider.  We next turn to this role.<p>
<h4>The role of provider</h4><p>
Concurrently with the need to reduce potential burden on the answerers,
the askers need to know that they can ask their questions without psychological
or social cost.  To effectively continue the Help Instance as a sociality,
then, the answerers must not belittle or berate the askers.  While being
clueful provides the understanding necessary to provide answers, it does not
necessarily result in suitable exchanges. Users must also learn how to answer
appropriately for the social space.  <p>
The responses are expected to be nuanced according to the asker's capabilities
and to be polite.  In the following example, taken from a longer exchange,
<tt>hasan</tt> has asked how to change permissions on a subdirectory so that
other users can access it.  This is an arcane task in the Athena environment
because of its complex access control.  The entire exchange takes 41 minutes
(interwoven with several others) and has 9 participants.  At one point,
<tt>sirius</tt> tries to be helpful and provides some elementary information.
<tt>hasan</tt> gets indignant at the assumption, and <tt>sirius</tt> tells him
that he was trying to be a helpful information provider.  The [...] indicates
that several extraneous messages were omitted between <tt>hasan</tt>'s message
and <tt>sirius</tt>'s response.  <p>
<tt>Time: 10:49:17 Date: Mon Oct 18 1993</tt><br>
<tt>From: he said, she said. &lt;sirius&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>by the way, hasan,  ~ means your home </tt><br>
<tt>directory, which, in your case, is</tt><br>
<tt>/mit/hasan</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt>Time: 10:50:18 Date: Mon Oct 18 1993</tt><br>
<tt>From: Hasan &lt;hasan&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>Bloody hell, I did know that. Humph.</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt>[...]</tt><br>
<tt>Time: 10:53:31 Date: Mon Oct 18 1993</tt><br>
<tt>From: Moonlight reflects the rain. &lt;sirius&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>hasan -- sorry if some of the things </tt><br>
<tt>I'm telling you are things you</tt><br>
<tt>already know ... but it's difficult to </tt><br>
<tt>judge how much someone knows, and lots</tt><br>
<tt>of people will not ask about confusing </tt><br>
<tt>jargon even if it is meaningless t</tt><br>
<tt>to them.</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt></tt>Sharp or acerbic answers often bring a response from other answerers.
After one answerer was curt with a naive questioner, he was taken to task not
to be sharp:<p>
<tt>Time: 16:15:02 Date: Sat Dec 11 1993</tt><br>
<tt>From: Paul Su &lt;pauls&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>Switch to help.d?</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt>"Which word didn't you understand?" is one of my pet peeves. The true
answer is typically "It is not a particular word, but how the word is related
to the concepts under discussion". But almost always the person on the
receiving end of this doesn't have the tolerance to formulate such a formal
answer.</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt></tt>We should note that the Help Instance is "polite enough."  There are
no doubt users who find the tone dismissive, difficult, or problematic.
Nonetheless, we have noted a usual tone of politeness in the Zephyr exchanges.
Askers often send an extra message of thanks, and the answerers seldom are
dismissive.  <p>
<h4>The visibility of expertise</h4><p>
The two roles of asker and answerer get played out in a very publicly
visible environment.  Zephyr's user interface requires messages to be highly
public and visible, which adds to the system's social reinforcement.  The
visibility affords for public acceptance of an answerer's expertise, requires
self-control over incorrect answers, as well as provides an easy path by which
people can be recruited for the role of answerer.<p>
Answering questions <i>correctly</i> is extremely self-reinforcing in the MIT
culture.  With the culture's anchor in technical expertise (as is
"cluefulness"), one can gain the admiration of colleagues for showing
proficiency.  Said one interviewee, "I answer partially to be helpful, and I
answer partially to show off."  One's performance on the Help Instance is
public -- and visible to anyone subscribing.  If one is capable of correct
answers, then the Help Instance is a good forum for garnering the attention
most prized by the organizational culture.<p>
For undergraduates, who form the major population of Help Instance users, this
visibility and public performance have extra force.  As Davis found with his
student nurses [5], students must articulate and rehearse their future
professional roles to be successful within school and later in their careers.
Successful students come to understand this need, and quickly begin to practice
what Davis terms "role simulations" of "valued performances".<p>
The public performance of one's Help Instance activity also diminishes the
number of incorrect answers.  Since "cluefulness" or technical expertise is
enacted (i.e., agreed upon by both the participant and his audience), providing
incorrect answers detracts from one's preferred persona.  Information providers
seldom answer when they are uncertain, and if they do (e.g., when directly
asked) will mark uncertain answers appropriately.<p>
The public performance, combined with the ease of response, also results in
recruitment of new members.  The Help Instance "regulars" provide a stable
collectivity which a new recruit may gradually join.  Seeing one's questions
answered makes it more likely that one will ask questions.  Opportunities to
correct or elaborate on another's answers provide a forum for slowly increasing
one's answering without discomfort.  In a situation where no one is compelled
to answer, the opportunity to correct or supplement another (politely and
non-hostilely) is of high motivation.  New members, then, are gradually
recruited.<p>
<h4>Background attending and lightweightness</h4><p>
While the roles and norms are elaborated to reduce psychological cost
for users, participation might still be onerous or problematic without the
ability to ignore the Help Instance while attending to one's work.<p>
As mentioned, for people to ask questions, they must feel that they will find
an answer.  In order for the Help Instance to support collaborative problem
solving for its users, it must be attended by many users with various areas of
expertise.  However, requiring that any given individual provide answers could
be onerous, especially if that individual were a volunteer as in the case of
the Help Instance.  Furthermore, answering or even attending could interfere
with one's work performance, thus reducing the likelihood of participation.
Consequently, the system must allow many people to follow the progress of a
topic and join in the activity voluntarily, as they see fit.   Because the
interactions are rapid, conversation topics change quickly, allowing users to
phase in and out of attending without substantial loss.  The amount of work and
time required of users to help other users is dictated only by the helper him-
or herself.<p>
It appears to be socially permissible to not answer a question, even if
questions from other people are being answered.  We saw no evidence that this
was problematic.  If someone doesn't know the answer to question, it is rarely
said; the question simply goes unanswered.  These same guidelines enable others
to not answer a question even if they might know the answer.  For this reason,
answering a question is seen as a voluntary gesture, and users asking questions
should not expect help.  In the following exchange, <tt>loy</tt> is told that
he should be patient with not getting a response:<p>
<tt>Time: 21:09:07 Date: Wed Oct  6 1993</tt><br>
<tt>From: Why are wrong numbers never busy? &lt;loy&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>anyone heard of a software company called </tt><br>
<tt>metrowerks?</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt>Time: 21:14:18 Date: Wed Oct  6 1993</tt><br>
<tt>From: No hypothetical situations? &lt;loy&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>has anyone heard of a company called </tt><br>
<tt>metrowerks?</tt><br>
<tt>(if this is the second time this went here, </tt><br>
<tt>then I wasn't subbed before, out of practice, </tt><br>
<tt>sorry)</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt>Time: 21:14:44 Date: Wed Oct  6 1993</tt><br>
<tt>From: Synthetic syntax spoken &lt;descartes&gt;</tt><br>
<tt>No one answered the first time; presumably no</tt><br>
<tt>one here has heard of it.</tt><br>
<tt></tt><br>
<tt></tt>Background attending of a large silent audience also works as a check
on the quality of answers given by individuals.  As an earlier example showed,
users will correct answers, and the large attendant audience serves as a safety
net for people who ask questions.  Accordingly, there may be less fear of
asking questions or of misinforming others.<p>
The system capability for this lightweight attending assists in sustaining the
Help Instance.  Interestingly, the technical features that afford lightweight
attending include the limited display options.  The teletype window option lets
the Help Instance messages scroll by.  The scrolling action allows the user to
be conversationally current only on the messages that are still displayed on
the screen, reducing the burden on the user to immerse him or herself in a
longer-term context.  When Zephyr messages are displayed using pop-up windows,
each message has its own window.  When someone chooses not to attend, the
windows pile up on one another, with the most recent Zephyr message on top.
Users can then attend to only the most recent message which appears on top.
The system is largely memoryless.  This lack of memory and the possibility of
background attending provide for lightweight help; users need answer only as
they wish.<p>
<h4>CONCLUSIONS</h4><p>
The Zephyr Help Instance is a place where users can ask questions and
get expert, but polite answers.  It is also a place where users can answer
questions and feel satisfaction and social approval.  <p>
To continue providing help, the Help Instance requires, like any sociality, a
common-enough understanding of the space's purpose, a shared understanding of
the key roles (i.e., questioners and answerers), some norms about acceptable
and preferred behavior, and a positive adaptation to the organizational
culture.  In other words, in order to continue as a social place, there must be
a negotiated order of some sort.  The Zephyr Help Instance is a simple example
of this, but one that is effective and successful. <p>
These social mechanisms rely on several system features.  Zephyr is simple
technically.  But, we have discussed the usefulness found in its capabilities
for new instances (for policing of the topics), the system speed (for
background attending), the public messages (for rewarding and recruiting
answerers), as well as, paradoxically, the lack of memory and the poor display
options (for background attending).  Most importantly, the generality of
messaging allows users to negotiate their status and roles on the system.
Perhaps because the system is so simple, the users are able to effectively
negotiate their roles and statuses through the system.<p>
Some of the particular social mechanisms described here are specific to MIT or
similar organizations.  We would not expect to find "cluelessness" per se in
many other organizations (although we might find similar labels for new and
naive members).  Thus, these system affordances do not necessarily enable the
social mechanisms.  Instead, we note that the users have made creative use of
system affordances to organize and regulate their electronic social space.
Users were able to seize upon the system features for their own social
purposes.  The system affordances became resources in the users' world [11],
allowing the users to create and maintain a socially useful and usable system
over time.  Indeed, it is likely that other successful CSCW systems will have
similar adaptations.<p>
