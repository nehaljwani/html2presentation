<H1>ABSTRACT</H1>

<P>
The literature has long suggested that the design of computer
input devices should make use of the fine, smaller muscle groups
and joints in the fingers, since they are richly represented in
the human motor and sensory cortex and they have higher information
processing bandwidth than other body parts. This hypothesis, however,
has not been conclusively verified with empirical research. The
present work studied such a hypothesis in the context of designing
6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) input devices. The work attempts to
address both a practical need - designing efficient 6 DOF input
devices - and the theoretical issue of muscle group differences
in input control. Two alternative 6 DOF input devices, one including
and the other excluding the fingers from the 6 DOF manipulation,
were designed and tested in a 3D object docking experiment. Users'
task completion times were significantly shorter with the device
that utilised the fingers. The results of this study strongly
suggest that the shape and size of future input device designs
should constitute affordances that invite finger participation
in input control.

<H1>INTRODUCTION</H1>

<P>
This paper studies the effects of using different muscle groups
in 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) manipulation. In particular, it investigates
human performance differences in 6 DOF input control with and
without the involvement of the small muscle groups and joints
in the user's fingers. 
<P>
Increasingly, the user interfaces that we are designing and using
involve higher degrees of freedom than were found in first generation
GUIs. This places a higher load on the operators of such systems.
Consequently, it is all the more important that the motor and
cognitive resources of the operator be used to their greatest
effect. Many studies have already been conducted which address
issues in multiple DOF input (e.g. [11], [12], [14], [25], [26]
and [27]). 
<P>
The study reported in this paper adds to this literature. It investigates
how human performance in 6 DOF tasks varies according to the muscle
groups employed. The implications of this research are very practical.
If performance for a given task is higher when a particular muscle
group is employed, then future input devices can be tailored accordingly,
with affordances [8] that encourage the use of that group.
<P>
The present study was inspired by Card, Mackinlay and Robertson's
&quot;morphological analysis&quot; of the design space of input
devices, which suggested &quot;a promising direction for developing
a device to beat the mouse by using the bandwidth of the fingers&quot;
[2]. This prediction was based upon the well-established &quot;homunculus
model&quot; from neurophysiology (Figure 1) and some motor bandwidth
studies using Fitts' law tasks. However, empirical HCI studies
that support such a prediction have not been conclusive. One candidate
device which affords finger based manipulation and could therefore
conceivably &quot;beat&quot; the mouse is a pen shaped 2 DOF input
device such as the stylus studied by MacKenzie, Sellen and Buxton
[19]. In their comparison of a stylus with a mouse, however, the
results were inconclusive: the stylus outperformed the mouse in
dragging but not in pointing tasks. Furthermore, in the context
of conventional GUIs, even if the stylus were shown to result
in higher performance, the issue may well be moot. This is because
the time to acquire the device (i.e. the time for moving between
the keyboard and pointing device, which is much longer with the
stylus) may dominate the overall performance. We feel that such
&quot;side effects&quot; and the collective user experience with
the mouse as the &quot;standard&quot; 2 DOF computer input device
may make the replacement of the mouse with a finger operated device
a futile pursuit.

In the present study, for several reasons, we have chosen to focus
on 6 DOF tasks. First of all, there is not yet an accepted standard
6 DOF input device. Secondly, few would disagree that 6 DOF input
tasks are much more demanding than 2 DOF input tasks. Consequently,
if one particular design factor results in a slight advantage
in a 2 DOF input task, that same subtle advantage may manifest
itself to a much larger extent in 6 DOF input tasks.<p>

<H1>THE LITERATURE</H1>

<P>
As mentioned earlier, neurophysiological studies have shown that
various parts of the human body are anatomically reflected in
the brain disproportionately relative to their physical size and
mass, as illustrated by the homunculus model (Figure 1). Of particular
interest to the present study is the fact that representations
of the fingers and the hands in both the somatosensory cortex
and the motor cortex are much richer than those of the wrists,
elbows and shoulders. We may therefore expect performance enhancement
if fine muscle groups (i.e. fingers) are allowed to take part
in handling an input device. On the other hand, one should note
that the relationship between the size of cortical area and dexterity
has not been definitively proven in the field of neuroscience.

<P>
One of the first studies on the effects of different body parts
in manual control was done by Gibbs [6]. In a one dimensional
target acquisition task, Gibbs studied task performance of three
different body parts: the thumb (activated by the carpometacarpal
joint), the hand (activated by the wrist), and the forearm (activated
by the elbow), in both position and rate control systems with
various control gains and time delays. The performance ranking
in Gibbs&#146; study was, in decreasing order: hand, forearm,
thumb. 
<P>
Hammerton and Tickner later replicated Gibbs' study in a 2 DOF
target acquisition task [9]. Although Gibbs and Hammerton <I>et
al</I> subsequently argued about their experimental methodology
[7][10], the two studies in fact arrived at very similar conclusions,
that performance with the hand (wrist movement) was superior to
that of the thumb and the forearm. This advantage was greater
for more difficult tasks, such as those with long time delays
[9]. Note that both studies found that the wrist was more effective
than the thumb. Neither Gibbs nor Hammerton and Ticker included
fingers in their studies, however.
<P>
The motor performance of different limbs has also been investigated
in various Fitts' law studies. Fitts' law established the simple
linear relationship: MT = a + b ID in repetitive tapping tasks,
where MT is the movement time, ID = log2(2A/W) is the Index of
Difficulty, A is the movement amplitude and W is the width of
the target area [4]. The slope parameter b, in units of seconds/bit,
is the inverse of the motor system information processing rate.
Fitts' law studies have typically found this rate (1/b) to be
in the vicinity of 10 bits/second when the arm is involved in
the movement. 
<P>
Fitts speculated that other limbs, such as fingers, may show different
processing rates [4]. Subsequent studies in fact supported this
hypothesis. Langolf, Chaffin, and Foulke investigated the Fitts'
law relationship using amplitudes of A = 0.25 cm, A = 1.27 cm
and A &gt; 5.08 cm [16]. For the first two amplitudes, the experiment
was carried out using a microscope. For the large amplitude (&gt;5.08
cm), the experiment was carried with direct vision. Langolf and
colleagues observed that for A = 0.25 cm subjects moved the stylus
tip (a 1.1 mm peg) primarily with finger flexion and extension.
For A = 1.27 cm, flexion and extension of both wrist and fingers
occurred. For A &gt; 5.08 cm, the forearm and upper arm were involved
in the movements. On the basis of this method of allocating actuation
to different muscle groups by controlling the range of movement,
Langolf and colleagues concluded that the information processing
rates (1/b) for the fingers, wrist, and arm were 38 bits/sec,
23 bits/sec and 10 bits/sec respectively (see Figure 6 in [16]).
This study has been widely cited in the literature (e.g. [1];
[15]; [2]) as evidence that fingers are among the most dextrous
organs. Card and colleagues recently reviewed Fitts' law studies
with various body parts (finger, wrist, arm, neck) and pointed
out the limitations of the widely used computer input device -
the mouse [2]. 
<P>
In summary, both neurophysiological studies (the homunculus model)
and Fitts&#146; law studies suggest that use of the small muscle
groups (fingers and thumbs) should result in better performance
than the large muscle groups (arm and shoulder). However some
studies in manual control, such as Gibbs' study [6] and Hammerton
and Tickner's study [9], are not completely consistent with such
a prediction.
<P>
Due to the theoretical motivation, most studies in the literature
tend to compare performance of different muscle groups <I>against</I>
each other. From a practical and ecological point of view, such
a contrast is not necessary for the design of 6 DOF input devices.
The human upper limb as a whole (from shoulder to finger tips)
has evolved to be highly dextrous yet powerful. Every part of
it has its purpose and function. What is needed in input device
design is to make use of all parts of the associated limb, according
to their respective advantages. The larger muscle groups that
operate the wrist, elbow, and shoulder have more power and a larger
range of movement. The smaller muscle groups that operate the
fingers and thumb have more dexterity. When all the parts work
in synergy, movement range and dexterity can both be maximised.

<H1>TWO ALTERNATIVE DESIGNS</H1>

<P>
The preceding discussion suggests that performance improvement
in 6 DOF input does not necessarily lie simply in moving operations
from the large muscle groups to the smaller ones, but rather in
using the small muscle groups <I>in addition to</I> the large
ones. Motivated by this hypothesis, we designed and implemented
two alternative 6 DOF devices for this experiment: the Glove and
the FingerBall. The two designs were based on a single common
sensing technology, an Ascension Bird&#153;, and both were free
moving, isotonic devices operating in position control mode [27].
The critical difference between the two devices, therefore, lay
in the involvement of fingers in the manipulation of the 6 degrees
of freedom. 
<H2>The Glove</H2>

<P>
The first design was an instrumented glove (Figure 2) that had
been used in previous experiments [e.g. 28]. An Ascension Bird&#153;
magnetic tracker was attached to the centre of the palm of the
glove, the rotational centre of the hand. Also mounted on the
palm of the glove was a button with a T-bar. The clutch could
easily be pressed down by closing the fingers. The entire glove
device weighs 70g.
<center>
<P><img src="sz_fg2.gif" alt="Figure 2"><p>
<P>
<B>Figure 2</B> The 6 DOF glove <B><!--Figure 2 The 6 DOF glove --></B>
</center>
<P>
The Glove design resembles many of the common virtual reality
input devices. When using the Glove, all translation and rotation
operations are carried out by the user's shoulder, elbow and wrist,
i.e., the gross joints and muscle groups in the human limb. Other
than pressing the T-button, the smaller, finer joints and muscle
groups on the fingers were not utilised for the 6 DOF manipulation.

<P>
The T-button was an essential component of the input glove. Since
the Glove requires rotation to be made with the wrist, the elbow
and the shoulder, its range of rotation is limited. Whenever a
limit is reached, the user needs the clutch to disengage the manipulated
object (by releasing the T-button under the fingers) and restore
the hand to a more comfortable posture, and then recommence the
manipulation (by re-closing the fingers). This is very similar
to lifting a 2 DOF mouse and starting from a new position on the
mouse pad. We refer to this process as &#147;re-clutching&#148;.

<P>
The majority of existing designs of freely moving 6 DOF devices,
such as the &#147;Bat&#148; [25], the &#147;Cricket&#148; [3]
and the 3D mouse [17] are similar to the glove design in assigning
wrist, elbow and shoulder muscle groups for manipulating the six
degrees of freedom; however, none of these make use of the fingers.

<H2>The FingerBall</H2>

<P>
The second design is shown in Figure 3. This device has been dubbed
the FingerBall, to reflect the ability to operate it with both
arm and fingers. 
<P>
<center>
<P><img src="sz_fg3.gif" alt="Figure 3"><p>
<B>Figure 3</B> The FingerBall<B><!--Figure 3 The FingerBall--></B>
</center>
<P>
The ball shape was chosen because a symmetrical ball shape can
easily be grasped and manipulated by the fingers in all directions.
The FingerBall is designed to be held and moved (rolled) by the
fingers, wrist, elbow and shoulder, in postures that have been
classified as &quot;precision grasp&quot;, as opposed to &quot;power
grasp&quot; [18]. Precision grasping, while holding objects with
the finger tips, places emphasis on dexterity and sensitivity.
In contrast, power grasping, while holding objects against the
palm, puts emphasis on security and power. The FingerBall has
been designed with a versatile shape that is compatible with a
variety of virtual object shapes. This approach of choosing a
versatile shape is an alternative to the approach of making &quot;props&quot;
that are designed to resemble features of virtual objects being
manipulated [11]. The FingerBall instead is similar to the concept
of &quot;bricks&quot; [5],  which are universal physical handles
to various virtual objects.
<P>
To take maximum advantage of finger operations, two additional
features would be desirable. One is to make the ball <I>tetherless</I>,
so that the user can roll it freely between her fingers without
interference. The second desirable feature is that the ball be
made of an elastic, conductive material, so that the entire ball
functions as a button that can be squeezed from any direction.
Since enabling technology for wireless design is not easily available,
the FingerBall currently uses the Ascension Bird&#153; tracker
mounted in the centre of a sponge filled ball 6 cm in diameter.
The entire FingerBall weighs 66g. The cord of the Bird is pointed
away from the hand in the null position, so as to maximise the
range of rotation without interference from the cord (Figure 3).
Furthermore, since the FingerBall can be rotated up to 180 degrees
in any direction, it did not require a clutch as in the glove
design for the task used in the following experiment. It was therefore
not necessary to implement a button for the FingerBall in the
experiment.
<P>
The 3BallTM, manufactured by Polhemus [20], is a commercial product
similar to the FingerBall design. The limitation of the 3Ball
is its fixed button location. In order to access this button,
users can not freely roll the ball between their fingers. Another
spherical implementation of a 6 DOF tracker, the &quot;Cue Ball,&quot;
was demonstrated by Dan Venolia at the CHI'90 Interactive Experience.
<H1>EXPERIMENT</H1>

<H2>Experimental Set-up</H2>

<H3>Experimental Platform and Display </H3>

<P>
The experiment was conducted with a desktop stereoscopic virtual
environment, MITS (Manipulation In Three Space). As illustrated
in Figure 4, MITS consists of a SGI IRIS 4D/310 GTX graphics workstation,
CrystalEyes&#153; stereoscopic glasses, several 6 DOF input devices
and a software system developed by the first author.
<P>
<center>
<P><img src="sz_fg4.gif" alt="Figure 4"><p>
<B>Figure 4</B>  Experiment Set-up
</center>
<P>
Since the overall objective of this experiment was to evaluate
6 DOF input interfaces, the emphasis in designing the display
was to provide the largest possible number of 3D spatial cues.
This was to ensure that the task performance was driven predominantly
by differences in input controller conditions rather than by difficulties
in perceiving depth information. A 120 Hz sequential switching
stereoscopic display was employed, which has been shown to be
a necessary feature for this kind of experiment. To enhance the
3D effect, perspective projection and interposition cues were
also implemented. The tetrahedra were drawn in wireframe so that
all edges and corners of the objects could be perceived simultaneously.
Subjects were asked to sit on a chair approximately 60 cm away
from the computer screen for all experimental conditions (Figure
4).
<H3>Experimental Conditions</H3>

<P>
Two experimental conditions, the Glove and the FingerBall, were
used in this experiment. A pilot study showed that the best performances
for both conditions were achieved when the control display ratio
(control gain) was 1 (both translation and rotation). In such
cases, subjects can take the advantage of the direct, one-to-one
correspondence between the input and the display.
<H3>Experimental Task</H3>

A 6 DOF docking task, illustrated in Figure 5, was used for this
experiment. This represents a common elemental task that is involved
in many higher level interactions. In the experiment, subjects
were asked to move a 3D cursor as quickly as possible to align
it with a 3D target. The cursor and the target were two tetrahedra
of equal size (4.2 cm from the centre to each vertex). The edges
and vertex markers (bars and spherical stars) of both tetrahedra
were coloured so that there was only one correct match in orientation.
The markers superimposed on each corner of the tetrahedra served
multiple purposes. The stars on the target indicated the acceptable
3D error tolerance for each vertex (0.84 cm). The two types of
markers (stars and bars) served also to differentiate the target
from the cursor.
<P>
<center>
<P><img src="sz_fg5.gif" alt="Figure 5"><p>
<B>Figure 5</B> The Experimental Task
</center>
<P>
At the beginning of each experimental trial the cursor appeared
in the centre of the 3D space while the target randomly appeared
in one of five pre-set locations (14 cm, 11.5 cm, 12 cm, 7 cm,
and 10 cm away from the centre of the cursor in five arbitrary
directions) and orientations (110, 98, 106, 140, and 115 degrees
mismatched with the cursor about five arbitrary axes). In contrast
to the data gathering trials, during practice sessions the target
appeared in completely random locations and orientations. 
<P>
During the trial, whenever a corner of the cursor entered into
the tolerance volume surrounding the <I>corresponding</I> corner
of the target, the star on that corner changed its colour as an
indication of capture. Whenever all four corresponding corners
stayed concurrently matched for 0.7 seconds, the trial was deemed
completed. At the end of each trial, the trial completion time
was printed on the screen. The beginning of each trial was signalled
with a long auditory beep and the end of each trial was signalled
with a short beep.
<H3>Experimental Design</H3>

<P>
A within-subjects design was used in this experiment, in consideration
of efficiency. Each subject was tested with both of the two conditions,
Glove and FingerBall, on the same day. According to the results
of our previous research in [27-29], users' performance with 6
DOF isotonic position control inputs tended to stabilise after
20 minutes of practice. In this experiment, each condition was
given about 25 minutes of exposure, which comprised a short demonstration,
two warm-up trials, five tests and some practice trials between
tests. Each test consisted of two identical blocks of trials.
Each block had 5 trials with 5 distinctive initial target locations
in random order. Test 1 started after a short demonstration and
two warm-up trials. Test 2, Test 3, Test 4 and Test 5 started
5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes after the beginning of Test 1 respectively.
Subjects were alternatively assigned to one of the two experiment
orders: Glove first (GB) and FingerBall first (BG). After completing
the first condition, each subject received a short break before
proceeding to the second condition. 
<H3>Subjects </H3>

<P>
Twelve paid volunteers who had no previous experience with 6 DOF
input devices were recruited. Two of them failed to pass the screening
test due to weak stereopsis (using a Baush and Lomb Orthorator).
The remaining 10 participated in the complete experiment. Their
ages ranged from 22 to 33, with a median of 29. Eight of the subjects
were right handed and two were left handed. Subjects were asked
to use their dominant hand with both input devices (FingerBall
or Glove).
<H2>Experimental Results and Discussion</H2>

<H3>First Analysis of the Overall Results</H3>

<P>
In the following data analyses, statistical model residuals were
analysed first and it was found that the residual distributions
were skewed towards lower scores. This is typical when completion
time is used as a performance measure. Data with such skewed distributions
do not strictly meet the assumption of analysis of variance (ANOVA).
We therefore applied a common correction technique, log transformation
[13], to all time data in the following ANOVA significance tests.
For ease of comprehension, however, all numbers and figures illustrating
results are still presented according to the original, untransformed
scale.
<P>
Figure 6 shows the subjects' mean trial completion times for each
of the five tests. On average, task completion times were clearly
shorter for the FingerBall than for the glove in each of the five
tests. Repeated measure variance analysis showed that overall
performance scores for the two devices were significantly different:
F(1, 8) = 26.554, p &lt; 0.005. 
<P>
<center>
<P><img src="sz_fg6.gif" alt="Figure 6"><p>
<B>Figure 6</B> Task completion times with FingerBall and Glove

</center>
<P>
With both modes, subjects significantly improved their performances
over the course of the five experimental phases: F(4, 32) = 34.04,
p &lt; 0.0001. In addition, the performance differences between
the two modes were independent of experimental phase, as indicated
by the absence of a significant Device x Phase interaction: F(4,
32) &lt; 1, p &gt; 0.5. The performance differences between the
two modes were also independent of initial target location / orientation:
F(4, 32) = 1.28, p = 0.3. <!--With both modes, subjects significantly improved their performances over the course of the five experimental phases F(4, 32) = 34.04, p &lt; 0.0001. In addition, the performance differences between the two modes were independent of experimental phase, a-->
<P>
Other significant factors included Block: F(1,8) = 26.44, p &lt;
0.001. As stated earlier, each test consisted of two blocks of
trials. Completion times in the second block were significantly
shorter than for the first block, due to an obvious learning effect.

<P>
The presentation order of the two modes was not significant: F(1,8)
= 2.2, p = 0.17, but the Order x Device interaction was significant:
F(1,8) = 22.587, p &lt; 0.005. This could imply the presence of
an <I>asymmetrical</I> <I>skill transfer</I> as an artifact of
the within-subjects design, a factor which is an often overlooked
and which can result in misleading conclusions in such experimental
research. As Poulton [21, 22] argued, with a within-subjects design,
the actual skill transfer from one condition to another might
not be symmetrical, even though subjects&#146; exposures to the
two conditions are ostensibly equalised. 
<P>
In the present experiment, the Order x Device x Phase interaction
is also significant (F(4,32) = 8.7, p &lt; 0.0001) indicating
that, if there was an asymmetrical transfer effect, it varied
with experimental phase. It is thus very likely that asymmetrical
transfer might have been a significant factor in the early experimental
phases but not in the later phases. Two approaches were therefore
taken, respectively described in the following two subsections,
to test if asymmetrical skill transfer was likely to have been
the only cause of the performance difference between the FingerBall
and the Glove.
<H3>A Between-Subjects Analysis </H3>

<P>
In order to remove the possibility that the preceding results
were due solely to asymmetrical skill transfer, an equivalent
between subjects analysis was carried out using only the data
for the first device used by each group of subjects, thereby eliminating
any potential asymmetrical ordering effects. In other words, subjects
were divided into two groups, where members of the FingerBall
group were the subjects who were tested with the FingerBall first
and the Glove later. Their data with the Glove were discarded
for the between subject analysis. Similarly, the FingerBall data
were discarded for the group who tested the Glove first. This
approach was expected to be much less sensitive than the within
subject analysis in the preceding section. 
<P>
Figure 7 shows the results after discarding half of the data in
this fashion. Results of a repeated measure variance analysis
based on these between-subjects data were consistent with the
early analysis, i.e., completion times with the FingerBall were
significantly shorter than the glove: F(1,8) = 3.6, p &lt; 0.05.
Learning apparently did not reduce this difference, as the Phase
x Device interaction was not significant: F(4, 32) &lt; 1, p &gt;
0.5. 
<P>

<B>Figure 7</B> The FingerBall vs. the glove with 5 subjects in
each group (between-subjects)
</center>
<H3>Performance Analysis of the Final Test</H3>

<P>
As an additional verification that asymmetrical skill transfer
effect was indeed not the fundamental cause of the performance
difference between the Glove and the FingerBall, we also analysed
users' performance in the final test for each condition. As implied
by the significant Order x Device x Phase interaction in the initial
within-subjects analysis, it was very unlikely that asymmetrical
skill transfer was still in effect in Test 5, after 4 tests and
20 minutes of practice with the second device. Indeed, a repeated
measure within-subjects variance analysis on the data from Test
5 again confirmed the previous conclusions: completion time was
significantly shorter with the FingerBall than with the Glove:
F(1, 8) = 15.8, p &lt; 0.005. Furthermore, neither Order of presentation
nor Order x Device interaction was significant, implying that
any possible skill transfer effect between conditions did not
significantly affect performance in the final test. 
<P>
On the basis of all three of the above analyses, we can therefore
confidently conclude that the FingerBall significantly outperformed
the Glove in the experiment.
<H3>The Effect of Clutching vs. Muscle Groups</H3>

<P>
From a practical point of view, the above analyses have concluded
that the FingerBall is a more efficient device than the Glove.
However, from a more theoretical point of view, the cause of the
performance differences is still not clear. As described earlier,
the FingerBall differs from the glove in two major aspects: the
use of finger joints and the absence of a button (and the accompanying
re-clutching processes). With the Glove, the re-clutching process
takes time to complete. Subjects usually carried out 1 to 3 clutches
/ declutches in each trial. This could therefore have been the
sole cause of the performance differences in the above analyses,
while obfuscating any effects of using finger joints / muscle
groups. 
<P>
This issue had in fact been considered during the design stage
of the experiment, however, and the re-clutching times (from the
moment of disengaging to the moment of re-engaging) accumulated
in each trial were measured and recorded during each trial. In
the following analysis, the re-clutching times were subtracted
from the trial completion times for the Glove condition. The resulting
net score is labelled as &quot;C-R time&quot;. For the FingerBall
condition, for which no clutching was necessary, C-R time was
identical to the original completion time itself. Figure 8 shows
the mean completion time with the FingerBall, the mean completion
time with the Glove, and the re-clutching time with the Glove,
all from Test 5. The mean re-clutching time in Test 5 was 1.06
seconds, accounting for 10.7% of the mean completion time with
the Glove (Figure 8).

<p>
Note that the C-R time measure is biased against the FingerBall
condition, for two reasons. First, with the FingerBall, the re-clutching
process still exists effectively, although not explicitly. From
time to time subjects had to move their fingers to different parts
of the ball's surface to make further rotation. This effort (and
associated time) was not taken into account by the adjusted C-R
time measure, since no explicit re-clutching time could be measured.
Second, during the re-clutching time with the Glove, subjects
were not necessarily idle but probably were instead engaged in
mentally making decisions about what to do next. Since it is known
that mental rotation takes up a certain amount of time [24], this
time may overlap with the re-clutching time in the Glove condition
and is therefore reduced in the C-R time measure. Nevertheless,
C-R time serves as a conservative measure to test if the use of
fingers really was advantageous. If the FingerBall still outperformed
the Glove, as measured by C-R time, the advantage of using fine
joints must therefore exist. The converse may not be true, however.
<P>
Figure 9 shows the performance differences between the FingerBall
and the Glove as measured by C-R time. As can be seen, the mean
completion times with the FingerBall were still shorter than the
mean C-R times with the Glove. Repeated measure variance analysis
of C-R times collected in Test 5 (final phase of the experiment)
showed that the difference between completion times with the FingerBall
and the C-R times with the Glove was still significant: F(1,8)
= 5.324, p &lt; 0.05. Neither the order of presentation nor its
interaction with the device was statistically significant, suggesting
that this difference was not caused by asymmetrical skill transfer.
This analysis therefore further supports the conclusion that the
use of different muscle groups was indeed a major cause of the
superior performance of the FingerBall as compared to the Glove.

<H3>Subjective Evaluation</H3>

<P>
Upon completing the experimental trials, subjects subjectively
rated each of the devices on a continuous scale ranging from -2
to +2 (-2: very low, -1: low, 0: OK, 1: high, 2: very high). On
average, the FingerBall received higher ratings than the Glove
(mean value: 0.78 vs. 0.60). Of the 10 subjects, however, only
6 rated the FingerBall higher than the Glove<B>;</B> the other
4 subjects rated the Glove higher than the FingerBall (Figure
10). This is an interesting contrast to the task performance measures.
In the final test, all subjects, except subject A, had shorter
task completion times with the FingerBall than with the Glove.
It appeared, therefore, that subjective preferences were strongly
affected by some salient features of the devices other than performance.
Subjects were encouraged to jot down comments on features about
which they felt strongly. Seven subjects felt that the cord with
the FingerBall got in the way. Three subjects did not like the
wrist rotations imposed by the Glove. Two subjects wrote that
the FingerBall was less natural than the Glove. Surprisingly,
one subject particularly liked the clutch function with the Glove.
One subject reported fatigue with both devices. The fact that
the Glove device is closer to what is typically encountered in
&quot;virtual reality&quot; systems could also have been an influential
factor in subjects' preferences.<!--.-->

<H1>CONCLUSIONS</H1>

<P>
On the basis of neurophysiological findings (the homunculus model)
and Fitts' law studies, researchers have hypothesised that computer
input devices that are manipulated by fingers (the small muscle
groups) should have performance advantages over devices that are
operated by the wrist and/or elbow and/or shoulder (the large
muscle groups) [2]. It was believed that devices designed to conform
to such a hypothesis would outperform the mouse - the standard
2 DOF computer input device. Follow- up studies that test such
a hypothesis or apply it to new designs have not been reported
in the literature, however<!--due the fact that the mouse has been well accepted as the standard 2 DOF input device-->.
Designing efficient 6 DOF input devices thus presents a practical
need, as well as a research opportunity to test the hypothesis
of muscle group differences. Through an empirical study it was
found that assignment of the muscle groups in manipulating an
input device was indeed a very critical factor determining user
performance. Our results show that in a 6 DOF docking task, trial
completion times for an input device that included fingers during
6 DOF manipulation (the FingerBall) were significantly shorter
than those of a device that excluded the fingers from the 6 DOF
manipulation (the Glove). The results of our study strongly suggest
that future designers of such input devices should design the
affordances of input devices (i.e. shape and size) such that the
fingers are included in their operation to whatever extent is
feasible.
