<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
We present a new systematic method of structuring information using mental 
models.  This method can be used both to evaluate the efficiency of an 
information structure and to build user-centered information structures.  In this 
paper we present the method using Boston tourist attractions as an example 
domain.  We describe several interfaces that take advantage of our mental 
models with an activation spreading network.  Multidimensional Scaling and 
Trajectory Mapping are used to build our mental models.  Because of the 
robustness of the technique, it is easy to compare individual difference in 
mental models and to customize interfaces for individual models.

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3><p>
We all know that a curious person can more efficiently absorb information when 
it is well structured than when it is arbitrarily scattered.  The question that every 
information architect then asks is, &quot;How might I best organize the information for 
that person?&quot;  This question contains three issues:  what structures are useful 
for organizing information in general, what structures are useful for organizing 
that information, and what structures are useful for organizing information for 
that person.  
<p>
<a name="r7c1"><a name="r15c1"><a name="r16c1"><a name="r4c1"><a name="r9c1"><a name="r13c1">

To answer these above questions, we propose (i) collecting experimental data 
from a number of subjects, (ii) analyzing the mental models of those subjects 
with Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) [<a href="#r7">7</a>, <a href="#r15">15</a>, <a href="#r16">16</a>]
and Trajectory Mapping (TM) [<a href="#r4">4</a>, 
<a href="#r9">9</a>, <a href="#r13">13</a>], and then (iii) using those models to design information structures. Such 
models should lead more quickly to suitable interfaces rather than beginning 
with trial and error explorations.
<p>

<a name="r5c1">
Before continuing on to details, we offer definitions of &quot;information structure&quot; and 
&quot;mental model.&quot;  By &quot;information structure&quot; we mean an arrangement of pieces 
of information.  The arrangement might be a 2-D array on a table or a screen, as 
in a card game or a spreadsheet.  It might also be a 1-D ordering of items, like a 
shopping list.  It could also consist of a set of information nodes with connecting 
association links, such as a hypertext.  All the pieces of information should 
belong to the same conceptual type category, such as numbers to add, tasks to 
do, or words to remember.  By &quot;mental model&quot; we mean not the explanatory 
model offered by Johnson-Laird [<a href="#r5">5</a>], but rather a more general definition:  the 
cognitive layout that a person uses to organize information in his or her 
memory.
<p>

<h3>THE EXAMPLE DOMAIN</h3><p>
Consider the map of Boston shown in Figure 1a.  We have chosen fifteen 
different sites of activity taken from a tour guide book (listed in Figure 1b).  This 
set of information pieces (or &quot;stimuli,&quot; as we will call them) is a very high-
dimensional in feature space, and it has a relatively large variance across 
people.  That is, there are many features that can be used to describe the 
stimuli, and people do so in significantly different ways.  As a contrasting 
example, a deck of playing cards contains very few features, namely the 
number of a card, its suit, and perhaps its color, and different people describe 
playing cards similarly.

<h3>MDS AND TM METHODS</h3><p>
A person who lives in Boston and knows the sites will have at least two mental 
models of them, one based on their geographic locations, and one based on 
their content.  In order to illustrate the capabilities of Multidimensional Scaling 
(MDS), first used by Torgerson [<a href="#r16">16</a>], Shepard [<a href="#r15">15</a>],
and Kruskal [<a href="#r7">7</a>], we collected 
data from two subjects for each of these mental models (Figure 3).  Note that the 
judgments based on geographic similarity (3a) are completely different from 
judgments based on content (3b).  The input data for MDS takes the form of 
pairwise similarity judgments, and the output is an arrangement of the stimuli in 
a metric space.  
<p>

To clarify the procedure for obtaining these MDS plots, we offer a simple 
example; consider a collection of seven black and white circles of different 
sizes.  In Figure 2a, these circles are arranged randomly along the edges of a 
similarity matrix.  The numbers show a subject's similarity rating on a scale of 1 
to 7.  From these numbers the MDS algorithm arranges the circles as shown in 
Figure 4, with neighboring circles being the most similar.
<p>
<a href="sag_fg2.htm"><img src="sagsfg2a.gif"></a>
<strong>Figure 2a:</strong>  Typical input data for the MDS algorithm; similarity data for black and white 
circles of different sizes.
7 = very similar; 1 = very dissimilar.<p>
<a href="sag_fg2.htm"><img src="sagsfg2b.gif"></a>
<strong>Figure 2b:</strong>  Typical input data for the TM algorithm; extrapolations and interpolations for 
black and white circles of different sizes. Here are 12 of 21 possible pairs.<hr><p>



<a name="r6c1">
The distances between the points in the output is usually a non-linear 
transformation of the values in the similarity matrix.  For Figure 3a, we asked the 
subjects for every pair of stimuli, &quot;On a scale from 1 to 7, how similar are stimuli 
X and Y in terms of their <strong>distance</strong> from each other?&quot;  For Figure 3b, we asked, 
&quot;How similar are stimuli X and Y in terms of their <strong>content or theme</strong>?&quot;  We then 
used KYST2 [<a href="#r6">6</a>] to run the MDS and generate the graphs shown.  
<p>

<strong>Figure 3a:</strong> MDS plot based on geographic similarity<p>
<a href="sag_fg3.htm"><img src="sagsfg3b.gif"></a>
<strong>Figure 3b:</strong> MDS plot based on content similarity<hr><p>


<a name="r11c1">
As one might expect, the distance-based MDS plot is similar to the actual map 
of Boston, though somewhat warped; the warping could stem from differing 
familiarity with the sites [<a href="#r11">11</a>] or from thinking of distance as travel time instead of 
geographic distance.  In the content-based MDS plot, similar activity sites like 
the Aquarium and the Zoo appear near each other, as do shopping areas 
Newbury Street and Quincy Market.  One can use the groupings of points in an 
MDS plot to assign features to clusters of points, as we have done in Figure 3b 
with the features, &quot;historical,&quot; etc.  Likewise, many researchers who use MDS 
would attempt to assign meaning to the axes of the plot, suggesting perhaps 
that the X-axis runs from &quot;playful to serious&quot; and Y-axis runs from &quot;outdoors to 
indoors&quot;.  Such labels or category assignments must be done carefully and 
should be verified with separate experiments, however, because they are often 
biased by the experimenter's a priori knowledge of the data.  
<p>

<a name="r4c2"><a name="r13c2"><a name="r14c1">
The reader might wonder what would be the outcome if we had asked subjects 
to give general similarity ratings without specifying what type of similarity.  
Would the resulting MDS plot have been an unfortunate mixture of the two plots 
in Figure 3?  This issue raises the question of how we could have known what 
types of similarity to separate if we knew nothing about the data to begin with.  
To answer this question, we introduce the relatively new Trajectory Mapping 
(TM) procedure [<a href="#r4">4</a>, <a href="#r13">13</a>, <a href="#r14">14</a>].  
<p>

For high-dimensional feature spaces, often TM can better delineate the features 
of the data than MDS.  Instead of giving similarity judgements as in MDS, the 
subject's task in TM is to imagine a conceptual feature or property that links a 
given pair of stimuli.  The subject then extrapolates that feature in both 
directions to pick two stimuli from the remaining set that would be appropriate.  
The subject also picks an interpolant, i.e. a stimulus that would fit well within the 
pair. 
<p>

Returning to our black and white circle example, a TM set of input data might 
appear as in Figure 2b.  The members of the original pair are in columns A and 
B; the extrapolants are in the two &quot;ex&quot; columns, and the interpolant in the &quot;int&quot; 
column.  As well as using a stimulus for each slot, the subject may also enter an 
&quot;X&quot; or a &quot;...&quot;.  An &quot;X&quot; indicates that the subject did not feel comfortable choosing 
a stimulus for that spot, and the &quot;...&quot;  indicates that the subject could imagine a 
stimulus that would fit there, but that such a stimulus was not present in the 
given data set to choose from. 
<p>

From this set of quintuples, we can now extract a connected graph of the stimuli 
in which the maximum number of quintuples fit.  For example, in the top row of 
Figure 2b, we have an ordered set of white circles ending in a small dot in one 
column, and a set of black circles ending in the same small dot in the other 
column.  If these quintuples are equally considered as constraints on the graph, 
the ending trajectory map will contain a path from the large white circle to the 
large black circle, going through the small dot, as shown in Figure 4.

<h3>BOSTON DATA</h3><p>
Figure 5 shows a trajectory map for tourist site data gathered from the authors.  
Note here that the positions of the nodes are not important; the mental model 
lies in the connections between the nodes, i.e. the topology of the graph.  The 
weights on the links are based not on similarity, but rather on the robustness of 
that link across a gamut of parameters within the TM algorithm.  The weight on a 
link can thus be thought of as the strength of the connection in the mental 
model.  (A TM algorithm is being fine-tuned for release by Gilbert.)
<p>
<a href="sag_fg5.htm"><img src="sagsfg5.gif"></a>
<strong>Figure 5:</strong>Trajectory map for the tourist site data
<hr><p>

By pruning the trajectory map to only its strongest links, one can see rough 
feature clusters emerge (see the heavier links in Figure 5).  In our example, the 
clusters are roughly similar to the estimated clusters in the MDS plot (Figure 2b).  
In a trajectory map, however, the stimuli are ordered within each cluster, e.g. 
Arboretum, Swan Boats, Aquarium/Zoo.  Figure 6 shows the combined mental 
models, a rough TM path drawn over the MDS content-based plot.

<a name="r12c1">
Because the tourist sites have several possible features that could be used by 
subjects to report their TM extrapolations and interpolations, one can discover 
the most salient features of the data set by running the algorithm across many 
subjects.  It is likely with this tourist site information, for example, that some 
subjects would do the TM based on geographic distance, while others would do 
it based on the content of the sites.  This feature difference would eventually 
manifest itself from obviously disparate trajectory maps, and lead to the 
phrasing of the MDS questions described earlier:  similarity in terms of distance 
and similarity in terms of content.  Examples of different trajectory maps for the 
same domain can be seen in [<a href="#r12">12</a>].

<h3>EXPERIMENTATION</h3><p>
The mental models from TM and MDS provide an excellent basis for measuring 
the efficiency of an information structure that has been built from the models.  
One might arrange the stimuli serially according to the TM paths or distribute 
them according to the MDS plot.  After collecting data from a new pool of 
subjects for measures of readability, ease of remembering, etc. (see [<a href="#r2">2</a>, <a href="#r3">3</a>] for a 
typical array of memory measures), the information structure can be 
systematically varied by changing the parameters that produce the MDS and 
TM models.
<p>

<h3>EXAMPLE INTERFACES</h3><p>
If one considers the set of tourist attractions as an information space to be 
explored, we can also use the mental models to give the user well-founded 
suggestions as to his or her next step of exploration.  As a demonstration of 
feasibility, we have designed a visualization system that allows the exploration 
of the Boston tourist attractions.  Since we are no longer restrained to the 
geography of Boston, as an actual tourist would be, we must now answer the 
question, &quot;How should we order the various sites?&quot;  To explore the different 
possible answers, we have built three different interfaces for the system, each of 
which defines an &quot;attentional window&quot; as the current region of interest in the 
information space.  An activation spreading network based on the mental 
models defines the size of the attentional window as the user explores. Thus, if 
the aquarium node of the network is currently activated, and the models suggest 
that the swan boats node is closely related, then the activation will spread to 
swan boats, leading the attentional window to include swan boats as a potential 
next focus.

<a href="sag_fg7.htm"><img src="sagsfg7b.gif"></a>
<strong>Figure 7b:</strong> Adults' activities energized by the regional activation spreading network.<hr><p>

In the first two interfaces, the 15 sites are arranged two-dimensionally according 
to the MDS plot in Figure 3b.  Whichever sites fall within the attentional window 
are rendered larger than the others.  In one interface, the attentional window 
envelops MDS regions (Figure 7), and in the other, the window spreads across 
TM paths (Figure 8).  Figure 7a shows the display of regional activation with 
emphasis on children's activities.  Figure 7b shows the activities in an adult 
context.  In contrast, Figure 8 shows several successive frames of path 
activation:  when the user investigates the Sports Museum, the network 
suggests that Fenway Park or the Children's Museum might be a good next 
choice (those two sites are slightly enlarged in Figure 8a).  As the user shifts 
attention to the next event, past activities fade away and activities further along 
the path become more conspicuous.

<strong>Figure 8:</strong>
The network activates the path segments when the user examines the sites Sports 
Museum, Fenway Park and Aquarium. The activation levels are mapped to image and 
typographic size, enabling the system to suggest to the user an appropriate next step based 
on the MDS and TM results.<hr><p>


The difference between these two styles of exploration can be characterized by 
the width of the attentional window:  narrow in the case of paths, and wide in the 
case of regions.  By smoothly varying the width, one might change smoothly 
between modes of exploration.
<p>

<strong>Figure 9:</strong>
An interface that combines path and region following; the sites are represented by 
cubes in a 3-D space.  The cubes lie along the TM paths, and the other sites from the MDS 
region encircle the cube within the attentional window.<hr><p>

The third interface attempts to combine the path and region following ideas of 
the first two.  This interface depicts the sites as semitransparent multimedia 
cubes in a 3-D space (Figure 9). The cubes are arranged along the TM paths, 
but at each cube, other cubes within the same region can be seen orbiting the 
current cube nearby.  Thus, the user can &quot;fly&quot; smoothly through the space along 
the TM routes, or branch off to a similar site within the current region.  Also, the 
floor of each cube displays a geographic map with the site's location high-
lighted, thus incorporating all of the features that we have discussed thus far.

The activation spreading network was designed by Lokuge and Ishizaki [<a href="#r10">10</a>], 
and the visualization system is implemented on a Silicon Graphics Onyx 
workstation [<a href="#r8">8</a>].  This network links nodes in a space (Figure 10) and uses the 
ordering in the space to control the activation level of a node [<a href="#r1">1</a>, <a href="#r12">12</a>].  When 
attention &quot;jumps&quot; to a new node, the network partially reduces the activation 
levels in the original set of nodes, leaving a faint trace as a history of the 
attentional sequence.

<h3>DISCUSSION</h3><p>
We have designed this visualization system with its various interfaces both as 
an existence proof that such a system could be devised and as an illustration of 
our proposed methodology for structuring information.  We mentioned above 
the fact that a variety of mental maps exist for each data set, both within and 
across individuals.  A further development would be an intelligent activation 
spreading network, i.e. one which contained the full repertoire of different 
mental models for a given data set and chose the best model based on the 
user's behavior.  Such a repertoire could be described as a &quot;hyper-mental-map&quot; 
and could likely formed by gathering MDS and TM data on the mental models 
as stimuli themselves.
<p>

We have proposed and implemented a method of organizing information space 
around cognitive maps.  We plan next to explore the degree to which this 
method can be used with more generalized domains of knowledge, but 
examples from previous MDS and TM papers lends us hope that the method 
could become generally applicable.  By accommodating an individual's search 
context (e.g. through paths or regions) and his or her particular model of a 
domain (e.g. a particular MDS or TM model), one can offer both a more 
personalized tour of the information space and a more easily absorbable mass 
of information.
