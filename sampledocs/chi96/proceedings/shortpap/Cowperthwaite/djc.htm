<h2>Abstract</h2>    
We describe a novel solution to the problem of occlusion in viewing
three-dimensional data.  A distortion function is used to clear a 
line of sight to previously obscured interior elements.

<h2>INTRODUCTION</H2>    
There is accumulating evidence [1] supporting the 
idea that three-dimensional representations of data are advantageous.
Unlike 2D techniques, 3D viewing encounters a fundamental 
problem in the display of information in  that it is  possible for an
object of interest to be partially or wholly occluded by  other
objects.  Current solutions provide access to such internal details
through the use of cutting planes, layer removal, fly-through, and
transparency.  However, such techniques result in the loss of
contextual information.
<p>
The recent desire to integrate knowledge and experience from the field 
of cognitive science into the design of user interfaces and new
interaction paradigms has led to an appreciation of the importance of
presenting data within its context [3][4].  Our goal is
to allow interactive access to 3D information spaces while maintaining
context. This is achieved by providing a viewer aligned visual access
distortion which clears a line of sight to the object of interest,
permitting examination from all angles.

<h2>VISUAL ACCESS DISTORTION</h2>    

The problem of occlusion arises when objects lie on or near the line
of sight, between the viewpoint and the focus.  The solution is to
move data objects away from the line of sight where necessary,
clearing a path to the focus.  A distortion is applied radially about
the line of sight, displacing data items in gradually decreasing
amounts as their distance from the line of sight increases (Figure 1).
Here the scale and hue of the focal node have been adjusted to
distinguish it from the other nodes.  
<p>
This method extends the ideas and techniques that to deal with
occlusion in 3DPS [2].  Our algorithm proceeds as follows. Let <em>L</em>
be a line segment extending from the focal object or region to the
viewpoint (the line of sight), and a vector <em>v</em> be the shortest
vector from any other object <em>O</em> at position <em>P</em> to a point <em>N</em> on the
line <em>L</em> (used to establish the direction of the displacement).  A
gaussian distribution is used to calculate the magnitude of the displacement
based on the length of <em>v</em>.
<p>
For a given value of |<em>v</em>| we determine the height <em>h</em> of the
gaussian.  The characteristic bell-curve of the gaussian means that
for points near the line of sight (when |<em>v</em>| is small)  <em>h</em>,
will be greatest.  Points  further  from the line of sight will have
progressively  smaller displacement values (Figure
\ref{crossection}). The distribution of the distortion can be
controlled  by adjusting the height and standard deviation of the
curve.  Since the viewing direction is along the line of sight the
resulting distortions will appear to  be radially symmetrical about
the focus.

Furthermore, the visibility of the focus will be maintained under
rotation of the data or motion of the viewpoint, smoothly deflecting
potentially occluding nodes away from the line of sight as they
approach it and returning them smoothly to their original positions (Figure 3).

more than one focus</strong>
<p>    
This method scales well to multiple focal points. Here the 
displacement <em>D</em> of any point <em>P</em> relative to a set of <em>n</em> line
segments <em>Li</em>, where each segment <em>Li</em> begins at an object of 
interest <em>Oi</em> and terminates at the viewpoint <em>V</em>, may be
summarized as follows:
<p>
<IMG SRC="djc_eqn.gif" ALT="Equation1"><p>    
<p>
where <em>Ni</em> is the point on the <em>ith</em> line segment nearest the
point <em>P</em> and <em>g()</em> is the function that returns the height of
a gaussian given the distance from the point <em>P</em> to the line <em>Li</em>.
The resulting displacement is the average of several independant
distortions, each in a radial direction  away from the line segment
<em>Li</em>. Thus it is possible to clear lines of sight to several objects
simultaneously. For example in Figure 4 the upper left
object is one layer deep into the 9x9x9 cube and the lower right one
is 8 layers deep, but still visible.

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>    
<p>    
The viewer aligned visual access distortion provides a clear line of
sight to the internal structures of 3D data sets while maintaining
 smooth integration within its context. It is view rather than data
aligned and provides control over the degree and extent of the
distortion. 
<p>
Future research includes the application of this method to both
general 3D graph structures and solid 3D data, and  an examination of
the potential use of perceptual cues  to reveal the nature of the distortions.<p>
