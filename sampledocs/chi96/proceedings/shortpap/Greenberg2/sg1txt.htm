<H2>ABSTRACT </H2>

In distributed communities, media spaces supply people with an
awareness of who is around by displaying video or periodic snapshots
of common areas and offices. This in turn facilitates casual interaction.
Peepholes is a low cost alternative. Instead of video, iconic
presence indicators show the availability of people in a virtual
community. If people are absent, a user can 'ambush' them by asking
the system to announce their return. When interaction is desired,
people can easily contact one another because communication software
is just a button-press away.

<H2>INTRODUCTION </H2>
<EM>Informal awareness</EM> of one's community is the general sense
of who is around and what others are up to-the kinds of things
that people track when they work together in the same physical
environment. This awareness is the glue that facilitates casual
interaction, the spontaneous and one-person initiated meetings
that form the backbone of everyday coordination and work [1,3].
Yet casual interaction is problematic in distributed communities.
While groupware is readily available, people have considerable
trouble staying aware of opportunities for collaboration, and
in establishing electronic meetings.

<P><EM>Media spaces </EM>are one way of providing distributed groups
with informal awareness of each other. Users can select offices
and common areas at remote sites, and view them through continuous
video. Yet even compressed video demands too much bandwidth for
everyday use. Portholes [2] partially solves this problem by periodically
transmitting small video snapshots instead of a video stream.
The community is presented on one's screen as an array of images.
However, Portholes still requires people to have video cameras
attached to their workstations and a willingness to leave them
turned on. 

<P>An alternative to video is iconic <EM>presence indicators</EM> that
show who is around and the likelihood of their availability. This
paper shows how presence indicators, as implemented in Peepholes,
afford casual interaction, especially when they are integrated
with common communication and groupware facilities.

<H2>PEEPHOLES </H2>
<H3>Creating a virtual work community. </H3>
Users can create their virtual community in Peepholes by choosing
potential collaborators from an electronic address book. For example,
Figure 1 shows a virtual community of five people selected from
the book. Each person is represented by a labeled icon and optional
address entry.

<P>Peepholes automatically maintains the address book. It first scans
incoming email for names and electronic addresses, and then adds
new members to the book or updates old ones. This tracks people
who have recently communicated with the user, and who are likely
to be part of one's virtual community. In the book, a user can
create sub-communities and assign people to them. Particular sub-communities
can then be recalled quickly.

<H3>Informal awareness through activity indicators. </H3>
Opportunities for casual interaction happen when people are aware
that others are available for communication. On a network, similar
opportunities could occur if we could see who is actively working
at their computer. Because computers can easily capture and transmit
how long it has been since their users were active, this information
can be displayed as an estimate of a person's real availability.
For example, the Peephole icons in Figure 1 continually display
the activity status of each community member. Greenberg is now
active (denoted by a bold character), O'Grady has been idle for
a few minutes (the grayed out icon), Lowe is logged on but hasn't
used the computer in a while, Schaffer is logged off, and Roseman
is unreachable. A quick glance at these icons gives awareness
of people's probable availability for real time communication.
<P>

<H3>Ambushes for tracking availability. </H3>
It is not easy for one person to initiate a meeting over distance,
as people are often absent or not immediately available. While
activity indicators suggest when a call will work, they must be
monitored regularly to see when an absent person to return. Indeed,
users of the Cruiser media space would often open a full bandwidth
video connection to the empty office of a collaborator, solely
to 'ambush' its occupant, i.e., to see when they returned [3].
In Peepholes, users can ambush others through a menu option (Figure
1). When the system notices that the person has become active,
it announces their return by playing an audible sound of someone
typing. This attracts the ambusher's attention to the display,
allowing them to initiate a call if desired.
<P>

<H3>From informal awareness to making contact. </H3>
Moving from awareness of another's availability to an informal
meeting is simple in physical environments but not on computers.
Electronic addresses must be found, software connections established,
system compatibility verified. Peepholes simplifies this by integrating
communication and groupware tools via hooks. Electronic addresses
are maintained in the address book, and connections established
by simply selecting a person's Peephole icon and an application
icon (Figure 1, bottom). Connections are literally a button click
away.
<P>

<H3>From asynchronous to casual interaction. </H3>
Email represents an opportunity for casual real-time interaction
that should not be ignored. Peepholes is linked to a mail reader
and, as people read their mail, a Peephole icon is automatically
raised on the sender (Figure 2). The user can see if the sender
is available for real time conversation, and contact them that
way if desired. This is particularly useful for incoming mail,
where it is more than likely that the sender is still active on
their machine.

<H2>Information for free. </H2>
Peepholes only uses information freely available on the network
[1]. No specialized software is installed at remote sites, allowing
it to be used anywhere on the Internet. It works by continually
querying the <EM>ruser daemons</EM> found on most Unix-based servers,
and by massaging the results. In practice, this is a reasonable
way to access many users. 
<P>

<H2>DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY </H2>
In actual use, Peepholes does let a user maintain informal awareness
and establish contact with others. As only a few bits of information
are transmitted and no special equipment required (<EM>cf video</EM>),
it is very low cost. Although activity indicators cannot tell
the difference between absent and inactive people, they are reasonable
indicators of another's availability. The ambush feature is a
surprisingly effective way of getting hold of another person.
Establishing connections is straight-forward, although software
incompatibilities do occur. Information "for free" is
useful but limited: some people are not observable because some
sites do not install the ruser daemon, or use restricted versions
of them, or insulate themselves from the outside world through
firewalls. 

<P>We are now taking the ideas in Peepholes and installing them as
components used by session managers in GroupKit, our groupware
toolkit. Peephole awareness will be the lowest common denominator
used to facilitate casual interaction. However, the system will
also check for more sophisticated capabilities and substitute
them when appropriate. For example, Peephole icons could be progressively
replaced by participants' images, by periodic snapshots, or even
by full video. If custom daemons are used, they can better track
awareness information, and can allow people to control the degree
of privacy desired.
