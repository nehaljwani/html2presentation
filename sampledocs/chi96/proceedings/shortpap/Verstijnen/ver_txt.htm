<P>Recent research into the psychology of paper-and-pencil sketching reveals

two ongoing interacting processes during a creative process. The first of

these processes can easily be performed in mental imagery and hence is not

supported by sketching, the second is hard to perform before the mental

eye, and hence is supported by sketching. It is argued that, in order to

be intuitive, electronic sketching tools must meet the requirements of firstly

not impeding the first of the two processes and secondly support and enhance

the second process.</P>

<P><B>INTRODUCTION</B></P>



<P>Although celebrated inventors, like Kekul&eacute; and Einstein, claim

they made their discoveries before their mental eye, industrial design
engineers

and artists generally get frustrated when any form of externalisation of

their mental images is withheld. Psychological research in the field of

visual imagery gives ambiguous answers to the question whether discoveries

can be made in imagery only. On one hand research of Finke and Slayton [2]

reveals results in agreement with the claim of the celebrated individuals,

on the other hand the results of Chambers and Reisberg [1] argue for a major

benefit by making mental images available for visual perception.</P>



<P><B>THEORY</B></P>



<P>We hypothesized that these opposing results could be reconciled if these

two lines of research had addressed two different mental processes. We
speculated

[5,6] that Finke's [2] mental imagery paradigm contains basically a spatial

task of moving elements around in space, and synthesizing these elements

into a larger whole. Such a task can easily be performed before the mental

eye. In this task only the alignment of the elements with respect to each

other is changed. The elements themselves remain intact and therefore keep

having the same identity as before the mental operation. This latter aspect

of the task is crucially different from the tasks practised in the experiments

of Chambers and Reisberg [1] and also Reed and Johnsen[3]. In their paradigms,

the constituent elements of a mental image had to be restructured to turn

into a fundamentally new identity with fundamentally new characteristics.

Their experiments compelled the subjects to abandon their initial
interpretation

of the elements of an image, in favor of a new unanticipated interpretation.

Then, in this new interpretation, they had to discover new unanticipated

information. In order for this to take place, restructuring of the elements

and formation of new unanticipated elements had to occur in mental imagery.

We speculated [5] that this latter process of discovery through restructuring

is extremely difficult in mental imagery. </P>



<P>If two different processes exist of which one is easy to perform in imagery

whereas the other is considerably difficult, differential benefit values

for externalization of images through paper-and-pencil sketching can be

expected. If a mental operation is easy, as in a synthesis task, little

or no benefit is to be expected. Major benefit is to be expected for a task

which is difficult to perform, as is the restructuring task. See Figure

1. </P>

<P><B>EXPERIMENTS</B></P>



<P>In two series of experiments, we investigated the benefit value of
sketching.

The first series embodied a task stressing the synthesis process, based

on the Finke paradigm [6]. The second series contained a Reed-like
restructuring

paradigm [5]. </P>



<P><B>PARADIGMS &amp; RESULTS</B></P>



<P><B>Synthesis task</B></P>



<P>In our Finke-like paradigm [2,6], subjects had to synthesize three simple

3D elements (e.g. cube, sphere, cone) into an object. Half of the subjects

were allowed to sketch, the other half was denied this possibility. It turned

out that subjects in both the groups equally applied different synthesizing

strategies. Occasionally, some of the original elements in the created objects

had undergone changes (e.g. changed proportions) during the task. These

element changes were more likely to emerge in the sketch group. Afterwards,

judges rated the objects on creativity. Subjects, who applied more synthesis

strategies were rated higher, as well as subjects with more element changes

in the original elements. Both measures contributed equally to the creativity

ratings.</P>

<TD WIDTH="245" VALIGN="TOP"><P><B>Restructuring task</B></P>



<P>In the Reed-like task [4,5], a configuration of 3 overlapping simple

2D wire-frame elements (e.g. square, diamond, right-angled triangle) was

briefly presented to the subjects. Such a short presentation time ensures

that people are not able to grasp more information from the configuration

than the identity of the three elements and their locations. Hence, elements

that result from overlap are not conceived, and the image has to be
restructured

in order to find these elements. Only subjects, who were allowed to sketch

performed well on finding these unanticipated elements and they spontaneously

started to sketch if allowed to. Finding these new elements in a sketch

had a high correlation with the element changes in the Finke-like task and

with scores on a creativity test.</P>



<P>In both series of experiments untrained sketchers performed worse on

the restructuring aspects than trained sketchers, whereas synthesis aspects

were performed equally well.</P>



<P><B>CONCLUSIONS</B></P>



<P>The results confirmed our hypotheses; The synthesis process is easy to

perform in imagery and not supported by sketching, the restructuring process

is difficult to perform in imagery and hence enhanced by sketching.
Furthermore,

we found that individual creativity enhances the restructuring process,

and that the two processes of synthesis and restructuring together constitute

the creation of a creative object. Synthesis and Analysis are hypothesized

to constitute a creative process in creativity literature. Because of the

parallels that can be drawn between these two processes and our two processes,

our restructuring process might well equate the Analysis process. </P>



<P><B>IMPLICATIONS FOR COMPUTER TOOLS</B></P>



<P>A list of requirements for both intuitive and helpful computer tools

can be deduced from these findings. </P>



<P>Since the synthesis process can be easily and rapidly performed before

the mental eye, only the end-product of this process is likely to be found

externalized. Synthesis itself is, according to our model, never an objective

for externalisation, and therefore will occur only in sketches intended

to support the restructuring process. Creation of synthesized objects on

a computer tool therefore must preferably pass unnoticed, effortlessly and

super fast. In the restructuring process the sketcher draws one particular

structure but intends to perceptually pick up a new structure with new
components

from the sketch. Keeping the sketch unspecific and vague allows for this.

The requirements for electronic tools that can be distilled from this
conclusion

is that either the tool has to support unspecific forms of input, or the

tool has to be able to switch easily between various structural descriptions

after creation.</P>



<P>Kolli &amp; Stuyver (reported in [3]) studied the 3D CAD programs
Pro-Engineer,

Intergraph-EMS, Atari-sculpt 3D and GIG3DGO. The first phase of this study

revealed that with today's programs even during a simple synthesis task

with simple elements one is faced with ample difficulty. With every program

this task consumed considerable time and certainly did not proceed smoothly

and unnoticed. Afterwards, in phase II, the subjects had to restructure

the elements of the synthesized objects. How the elements had to be
restructured

was not known at phase I. It turned out that some subjects choose a synthesis

form in the first phase that didn't support the altering of the elements

in the second phase and hence had to resynthesize the object completely.

This latter result indicates that restructuring is a cumbersome job with

current 3D CAD programs. </P>



<P>Considering that both processes, synthesis and restructuring, equally

constitute a creative process, requirements from both processes have to

be satisfied in a computer tool. Since, with current 3D CAD-programs, synthesis

turns out to be time-consuming where it has to pass unnoticed and restructuring

is hardly supported, current 3D CAD-programs don't seem appropriate for

supporting the creative process in the conceptual phase. Electronic sketch

tablets, which, like paper &amp; pencil, support unspecific input and leave

the synthesizing and restructuring to the sketchers still seem, for the

time being, to be more appropriate electronic idea-creation tools. </P>
