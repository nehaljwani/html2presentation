<H2>ABSTRACT </H2>
<P>
Conventional (visual) glances give a quick overview of the overall
properties of an object. An <I>audio glance</I> presents a similar
overview aurally rather than visually. This paper describes an
audio glance for electronic mail messages. This dynamically constructed
non-speech sound is designed to summarize the important properties
of a message into a concise sound so that one may quickly preview
a set of email messages to determine their important properties.
This allows the user to make a quick assessment of, for example,
the existence of messages from particular users or groups, or
of responses to a recent message of importance. Along with the
audio glance technique we present a &quot;flash card&quot; interface
which provides very rapid access to the glance. <BR>

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>
As the popularity of electronic mail as a communication medium
grows, people often find that they have too much email to organize
and prioritize effectively. Many people find themselves checking
their mail frequently to assess the nature and importance of recent
messages in order to quickly decide whether to read any of them,
and in general to keep up with events in their electronic community.
This paper describes the construction of audio glances for email
messages which allow this overview information to be obtained
quickly and unobtrusively by means of short non-speech sounds
constructed dynamically to portray the overall properties of each
message.
<P>
Although summary visualizations of email messages could also be
easily constructed (and could well complement our approach), presenting
glances in the audio medium provides several advantages. Because
audio is pervasive and fills the space it is presented in, information
can be presented in a hands- and eyes-free manner. This allows
an audio glance to be easily intermixed with other kinds of activities.
As a result, if properly designed, an audio glance may not require
one's full attention, and may be overlapped with other low-intensity
actions, or squeezed into short snippets of &quot;free&quot; time.
In addition, the audio medium is well suited to mobile applications,
and can for example, be accessed over the phone. (For other examples
of the use of non-speech audio, along with a more complete motivation
, see for example [1, 2]).<BR>
<H2>EMAIL GLANCE DESIGN</H2>
<P>
We have formulated email glances as a stream of short sounds,
each summarizing a single email message. These individual message
glances are constructed from up to four components as illustrated
in Figure 1. <BR>
<P>

<P>

</B></CENTER>
<P>
These components include an optional preamble sound (used to alert
the user to messages classified as important), a main audio icon
(used to identify the category of message, including who the message
is from, and whether it relates to certain important subjects
or message threads), a recipients icon (which codes for who the
message was sent to: e.g., a single user, a group of users, or
a mailing list), and zero or more content flag sounds (designed
to depict special features of the content of the message such
as key words or phrases in headers or the message body, as well
as recognizable MIME encapsulated objects, etc.). In addition,
the main audio icon is modified to indicate the overall size of
the body of the message. A short version of the sound (~0.5 sec.)
is played for short messages, a medium length sound (~ 1 sec.)
for medium messages, or a long sound (~2 sec.) for long messages
(cutoff sizes can be determined by user preference). 
<P>
Although the underlying system (described below) allows composition
of arbitrary sampled sounds, use of haphazardly choosen sounds
can easily lead to an unpleasent cacophony. Consequently, a series
of carefully designed recommended sounds are provided. These include
a short preamble sound (a throat clearing &quot;hmmphmm&quot;),
eight icon sounds (each in three lengths), three alternative recipient
icons sounds (for one, several, and mailing list recipients),
and several very short flag sounds. Since these sounds must fit
smoothly in an office environment, and potentially fade into the
background, nearly all of the sounds are designed not to be harsh
or attention demanding. Further, the sounds have been designed
to fit together without being too discordant, and the icon sounds
have as a group been designed to be distinguishable from one another
[3].

<H2>MESSAGE CATEGORIZATION</H2>
<P>
Each of the components of an audio glance sound is choosen based
on properties of a textual email message. To allow flexibility
in how the mapping between content and sound coding is performed,
we provide a small system for parsing and categorizing mail messages.
This system works on the basis of a small textual specification
language (which eventually will be hidden behind one or more direct
manipulation interfaces). 
<P>
This language provides capabilities similar to various mail filter
programs but specialized to creating audio glance sounds using
the structure described above. In particular, the language is
rule-based, providing for predicates that select messages, and
actions for constructing (partial) sounds when a message matching
the predicate is encountered. 
<P>
Predicates supported include the occurrence of a particular header
field, the occurrence of text matching a regular expression within
a specified field, any field, or the body of the message, occurrence
of text matching one of several regular expressions stored in
an external file, and comparisons against the size of a field
or the body. The inclusion of matches derived from information
in external files is particularly important since this makes it
easy for various user interfaces and external programs to maintain
&quot;hot topic&quot; and group lists dynamically. 
<P>
Normally, each email message is compared against each predicate.
When a message is matched, the associated action is performed.
This action typically fills in one of the components of the resulting
sound, but can also do things such as construct part of a composite
file name for a sound, append to a list of sounds for one component,
or force the message to be represented only by silence (a very
common occurrence). Facilities are also provided for initialization
and cleanup actions before and after each message is considered,
as well as special actions that are performed only on the first
message matching a particular predicate. <BR>
<H2>USE SCENARIOS</H2>
<P>
We envision several possible uses for email audio glances. Currently,
we have deployed it in a system for quickly assessing current
email while away from one's desk. In this case, the ability to
very quickly access the glance is critical to its utility. If
one needed to log in, start a window system, and run a program,
then log back out, etc. it would eliminate the benefit of getting
a quick overview. 
<P>
To overcome this problem, we have devised a method for invoking
a glance very quickly. As described in the next section, this
interface allows one to access the glance very quickly by holding
up a color coded card in front of one of a number of cameras (currently
in computer labs, but eventually in other public spaces). Since
email can be sensitive in nature, the public nature of audio and
the weak authentication used by this system might raise privacy
concerns. However, since glances reveal only audio previews and
no actual content, we believe that almost all users will find
this perfectly acceptable for use in public spaces.
<P>
Other potential use scenarios that we are exploring for future
work include invocation of the glance based on motion sensors
which detect when users return to their offices, as well as to
provide a preview for spoken email in a telephone or audio-only
PDA interface. <BR>
<H2>FLASH CARD INTERFACES</H2>
<P>
As indicated above, audio glances often need to be accessed very
quickly in order to make them worthwhile. In order to provide
instant access we have devised a system for &quot;flash card&quot;
interfaces. These interfaces invoke commands based on one or more
color coded cards held up to the camera of a workstation running
a &quot;flash card demon&quot;. 
<P>
Each of these laminated cards (a little larger than a typical
business card) contains a small number of color strips in a unique
combination. These cards are recognized by a simple color filtering
and histogram matching technique. First, a color filter is applied
to the input image in RGB space. This process essentially is a
selection of pixels which are inside a sphere surrounding the
target color (or colors) in RGB space. These target pixels are
&quot;grouped&quot; so only reasonably large, contiguous areas
of color remain. This process results in identifying large regions
of color matching one of a set of standard colors, while eliminating
all other &quot;background&quot; pixels. Simple, but very robust
color histogram matching techniques [4] (which are, for example,
insensitive to rotation) are then used to determine which if any
card is in view. Once a positive match is found the glance program
is invoked with the appropriate parameters. <BR>
