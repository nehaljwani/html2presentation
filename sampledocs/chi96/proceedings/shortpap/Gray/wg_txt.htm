<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>
<P>
How much time the user spends working on a task versus fiddling
with the tool is an important aspect of usability. The concept
of the <I>ratio</I> and <I>distribution</I> of <I>tool-only </I>operations
to total operations is proposed to capture this aspect.

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>
Using a tool to perform a task requires the user to translate
goals from a task space into subgoals and operations that are
executed in a tool space (Moran, 1983; Payne, Squibb &amp; Howes,
1990; Young, 1981). Task space goals can be as basic as withdrawing
some amount of money from your savings account (GET-CASH) or as
complex as employing a nuclear submarine to locate an enemy without
being detected yourself (LOCATE-SUB). 
<P>
Ideally, the task space subsumes the tool space. Sometimes, however,
the tool itself becomes problematic. Then, the goal temporarily
changes from performing the task to managing the tool. For example,
if you insert your card in the ATM and it is returned immediately,
you must change your focus from the task goal, GET-CASH, to the
tool goal, GET-ATM-TO-ACCEPT-CARD. You might try a different orientation
of the card in the slot; try a different ATM; or go inside the
bank to see if the card is damaged. Indeed, for the moment, task-goals
recede and tool-goals with their concomitant tool-only operations
dominate. (When this recently happened to one of the authors,
she was so busy trouble shooting the ATM card problem that she
forgot to complete the task goal, GET-CASH.)
<P>
For tasks that are executed on the computer, all operations on
the task, of necessity, entail an operation using the tool and
can be referred to as <I>tool-task</I> operations. However, as
with the ATM example, some operations are tool-only and have no
direct relationship to accomplishing the task. The current study
examines the <I>ratio</I> and <I>distribution</I> of tool-only
operations to all operations (tool-only + tool-task). The <I>ratio</I>
shows the relative effort that the person spends on managing the
tool rather than using it to perform the task. The <I>distribution</I>
refers to how the tool-only operations are distributed among the
tool-task operations. Our working hypothesis is that isolated
tool-only operations represent minor tweaks that distract minimally
from task performance. In contrast, sequences of tool-only operations
represent problem solving in the tool-only space that may disrupt
task performance.
<H2>METHOD</H2>
<P>
(A fuller report can be found in Gray, Kirschenbaum &amp; Ehret,
in preparation.)
<H3>Task &amp; Participants</H3>
<P>
Our data were collected as part of an effort to investigate the
pre-decision making processes of Submarine officers as they attempt
to locate an enemy submarine. For this report we include an hour
of data from 5 approach officers (AO). Each hour represents either
two 30 min. scenarios or one 60 min. scenario. All AOs had recently
served as commanding officers or executive officers on nuclear
submarines.
<H3>Procedure</H3>
<P>
The study used a high-fidelity simulation of the ocean environment
that was capable of creating a generic submarine and targets.
During the scenario, the AO controlled the situation by requesting
information and ordering actions much as they would on their own
ships. The simulation's keyboard and mouse was controlled by one
of the experimenters who is an expert user of the simulation.
(She is referred to in this report as <I>own ship operator</I>,
or OS-op.)
<H2>RESULTS</H2>
<H3>Encodings</H3>
<P>
All verbalizations and some screen events were transcribed and
segmented. Each of the transcripts was independently encoded by
two raters. (The full details of this procedure are given in Gray
et al., in preparation.)
<H3>Reliability of encodings</H3>
<P>
Across the five-hour corpus, 2,653 segments were encoded as one
of nine types of operations. Inter-rater reliabilities (Cohen's
kappa, <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">,</FONT></I> corrects for chance
matches) ranged from a low of = .61, <I>Z</I> = 16.51 to a high
of = .75, <I>Z</I> = 21.95.
<H3>Task, tool, and NA</H3>
<P>
For current purposes, the nine types of operations form three
categories: tool-only, tool-task, and NA. The 972 NA utterances
were irrelevant to both tool and task and were excluded from further
consideration.
<H3>Tool-only ratio and distribution</H3>
<P>
Because of the nature of this task, all task operations used the
tool. Thus, the tool-only ratio was computed as tool-only/total
operations (where total includes both tool-only and tool-task
operations). The mean tool-only ratio was 420/1661 or 0.25 (SD
= .05) and ranged from 0.21 to 0.34. (The data to calculate these
ratios are included as columns 2 and 3 of Table 1.)<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Table 1: Total operations (col. 2), ratio of tool-only/total
(col.3), and run length of tool-only operations (cols. 4-8), by
AO.</FONT>
<P>
<P>
As shown in Table 1, only 0.29 of the tool-only (TO) operations
occurred in isolation; that is, surrounded by tool-task (TT) operations
(e.g., TT--&gt;TO--&gt;TT). Most tool-only operations occurred
in runs of two or more. For example, 0.20 of the tool-only operations
occurred in runs of two (TT--&gt;TO--&gt;TO--&gt;TT); 0.19 in
runs of 3 (TT--&gt;TO--&gt;TO--&gt; TO--&gt;TT); 0.07 in runs
of 4, and 0.24 in runs of &#179;5.
<P>
The mean tool-only ratio in this study was .25 and over half of
the tool-only operations (0.51) occurred in runs of 3 or greater.
Despite an expert OS-op and the generally low standard deviations,
the highest to lowest tool-only ratios varied by a factor of 1.6
(from 0.21 for s07 to 0.34 for s10). The distribution of tool-only
operations varied as well. For example, for runs of 5 or more
the variation between AOs is 2.5 to 1, from 0.14 for s07 to 0.36
for s08. With only five subjects we cannot say whether these extremes
are due to individual differences or due to situation specific
events that arose while using the simulation.
<H2>SUMMARY &amp;AMP; CONCLUSIONS</H2>
<P>
We introduced the notions of the <I>ratio</I> and <I>distribution</I>
of <I>tool-only </I>operations and we advanced the claim that
these are important additions to how we measure and think about
usability. Our task required the interaction between two people,
a task expert (AO) and a tool expert (OS-op) and as such was well
constituted to elicit the type of verbal protocol data required
for our analyses.
<P>
As this is an exploratory effort, our conclusions must be modest.
We have no idea whether the tool-only ratios we report, when compared
to other tools and tasks, are high, low, or medium. Likewise,
while we can report that long sequences of tool-only operations
take attention away from task performance, we have no idea whether
the distributions we found are high, low, or about average. To
pursue these issues requires collecting much data over many different
tool and task combinations. Likewise, we are intrigued by the
finding that task experts interacting with the simulation via
a tool expert should vary so greatly in both the tool-only ratio
and distribution of tool-only operations. This second set of issues
requires correlating task performance with tool disruptions. As
a working hypothesis we assume that both higher ratios and longer
runs of tool-only operations are correlated with poorer task performance.
However, our modest contribution consists of asking the question,
not providing the answer.
