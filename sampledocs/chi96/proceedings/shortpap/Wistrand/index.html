<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
Presenting artwork such as paintings, graphics and other 
images over networks creates several problems, including 
loss of context, loss of image resolution and bandwidth rate 
problems. This paper presents a method, ImageTrees, for 
displaying images which attempts to solve these problems. 
Applications may be WWW applications, or other media 
where image resolution and bandwidth problems arise.

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
During the World Championships in Athletics 1995 in 
Göteborg, Sweden, was a large WWW service created, 
including event results and tourist information. Kjell Ringi, 
the artist of the official WCA posters made a simultaneous 
exhibition, both on WWW and in a traditional gallery. The 
traditional exhibition consisted of about 50 paintings and 
graphics, about half of which where displayed on WWW. 
<p>
The ImageTree display method was developed as a result 
from the problems inherent in displaying high resolution 
images using a relatively low bandwidth media such as 
WWW.
<p>
Artwork as paintings are normally stored as high resolution 
color images scanned from the original works. Hi-res images 
typically have a resolution ranging from several hundreds 
dpi and up, resulting in file size well over several megabytes. 
When displaying these images on a computer screen, several 
problems appear:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Loss of image resolution.
      Due to the limited screen space, images are often compressed
      to low-res thumbnail versions.
  <li>Bandwidth problems.
      Depending on the image compression and resolution, 
      transfer to the viewer may be slow.
  <li>Loss of image context.
      Navigation between images becomes difficult if no visible
      clues of the relations between images are present.
  <li>Static perspective.
      Interactive user exploration is hard to achieve compared 
      to a real-world gallery where the visitors may walk 
      around.
</ul>
Suggested solutions to problem such as these, are for 
example the Perspective Wall [<a href="#3">3</a>], various fisheye
views [<a href="#5">5</a>] 
and 3D recreation of the image gallery. These solution, 
however, relies on high bandwidth transfers to allow viewers 
to explore and zoom images and are thus hard to implement 
in relatively low bandwidth media as WWW applications, 
even though attempts have been made [<a href="#7">7</a>].

<h3>THE IMAGETREE</h3>
The ImageTree is a space-efficient layout and scaling model 
for 2D images, intended to be manipulated dynamically. 
Figure 1 below shows an example ImageTree.
<p>
<a href="fig1.gif"><img src="fig1_small.gif" border=0></a>
<p>
[ <a href="fig1.gif">Large version</a>
 |<a href="tree1.gif">additional example1</a>
 |<a href="tree2.gif">additional example2</a>
]
<p>
The images are positioned in a tree structure, with the image 
in focus placed as the root node and the rest of the images 
positioned as in a binary tree, with successive scale reduction 
for each level. By selecting individual images or levels in the 
tree, the tree may be rebuilt to place new images in focus.
<p>
Figure 2 shows an ImageTree scenario with seven images. 
Four states, A, B, C and D are shown, where A is the initial 
state - manually designed by the exhibitor presenting the 
images. Three selections are made: 1, 2 and 3 which result in 
an iterative refinement of a personal view of the total image 
set.
<p>
<a href="fig2.gif"><img src="fig2_small.gif" border=0></a>
<p>
The image in focus may act as a link to further information 
about the specific image. In the implementation described 
below, this information included a high-res zoomable image.

<h3>IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
The ImageTree system was implemented as a program for 
World Wide Web usage [<a href="#8">8</a>], in C++. The current state as well 
as the image set to use, were passed as part of the WWW 
URL, allowing the system to work a arbitrary set of images.
<p>
The different image sizes were generated dynamically by the 
WWW server in a first version, but this approach were later 
modified to use pregenerated images, since dynamically 
generating scaled images both interfered with server 
capacity and the caching mechanisms in common WWW 
browsers. Keeping image size low is important when 
designing WWW applications, since small low-res images 
are transferred much faster than large ones.

<h3>DISCUSSION</h3>
Hierarchical structures have been visualized in similar ways 
as the ImageTree, e.g. using Treemaps [<a href="#6">6</a>], but a primary 
goal of that method is to show the structure, not the 
individual images. ImageTrees uses a tree structure only as 
an aid in navigation, and users are encouraged to rebuild the 
tree structure to suit their individual needs.
<p>
Other information display methods as the The Document 
Lens [<a href="#4">4</a>], Pad++ [<a href="#1">1</a>] and fisheye
views [<a href="#5">5</a>] relies on high 
speed graphics and image transfer to allow users to change 
viewpoint in a static environment. ImageTrees compromises 
between image size and transfer speed by using a 
dynamically changing layout. The ImageTree method has 
been tested in a WWW environment where both users and 
the image artist expressed satisfaction with the method.

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
ImageTrees provides a personalized view of a possible large 
image set, while keeping bandwidth requirement low. The 
deepest levels in an ImageTree are not detailed enough to 
give complete information about the images, but provide 
context and promt users to explore further. 
<p>
The successive scale reduction can be viewed as an 
abstraction of real world perspective, where images far from 
the viewer are placed at a deep level in the ImageTree.
<p>
Compared to a 3D-representations of a gallery, ImageTrees 
uses tree depth as distance metaphor, while avoiding 
traditional 3D problems such as overlapping and hidden 
objects.

<h3>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h3>
The inspiration for the work on ImageTrees was very much 
depending on art material from Kjell Ringi and Gallery Æ. 
The WWW application were in part supported by the WCA 
Academy/Göteborg University/Chalmers and Telia.
