<FONT COLOR=#000000>Preliminary results and methodology is reported

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Click-ons, <B>COs</B>, are a common feature
of some types of educational software. Typically, when a child
mouse clicks on a portion of a scene, he/she is rewarded with
an animation, sound effect, or some other multi-media response.
With early childhood software, COs are sometimes designed to be
integral to the learning intent (e.g. <U>Play Room</U>, <U>Tree
House</U>, <U>From A to Zap</U>), but for other software an entertaining
interlude (with or without useful information) is the main purpose
of COs. <U>Counting on Frank</U>, <B>CoF</B>, an elementary mathematics
program developed by Electronic Arts in conjunction with E-GEMS
(Electronic Games for Education in Math and Science), contains
133 entertainment COs located in eight separate scenes. Researchers
with E-GEMS have analyzed students&iacute; interaction with CoF
COs as one component of their investigation into the development,
efficacy, and HCI issues involving edutainment (entertaining,
educational interactive media). This may be the first systematic
study of the nature of COs found in a commercial educational product.</FONT>
<P>
As part of a larger research study [1], CO data was collected
over two 4-week periods in a structured and supervised school
environment from 111 grade 4-5 students working in teams of 3,
and for a 2-week period from 9 children in an unstructured and
unsupervised home setting. The data consists of performance log
files which provide detailed information including the team/child
name, game state, screen position, and time associated with each
mouse click.<BR>
<P>
While using CoF, children may spend time on other activities:
1) solving word problems, 2) analyzing clues to determine a mystery
number, 3) playing four math strategy games, and 4) navigating.
Analyses of the log files for each team/child reveal diverse and
complex profiles.
<H2>SITE, TREND AND GENDER RESULTS</H2>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>The school groups spent an average of 26%
of their time with COs (s.d. 6%, range 13-41%) children at home
averaged 22% (s.d. 9.5%, range 10-34%). Actual time devoted to
COs for the school teams varied from 28 to 99 minutes; for the
children at home from 95 to 367 minutes. It is surprising that
the children at home spent a smaller proportion of their time
on COs than the children at school. It may be partly explained
by a much higher use of the assorted math games by children at
home.</FONT>
<P>
For 26 of the 36 school teams<B>, </B>over the eight sessions
the trend for the percentage of time devoted to COs declined,
sometimes followed by a levelling. However it is clear from the
significant bursts of CO activity (after episodes of math-focused
activity) which occur atop this trend that CO continued to be
a viable option (or diversion) for most students. The average
CO starting base was 46%; the average final trend value was 13%,
and the average burst was 29%. For the other 10 teams, the CO
use curve was either flat, cyclic, increased or random. 
<P>
An analysis of the entire mix of CoF activities (COs, problem,
clues, games) for both groups suggests a complex diversity of
play-preferences by students. This provides evidence to support
rich activity mixes for similar edutainment products. Information
on other aspects of CoF playing patterns can be found in [1].
<P>
A gender difference was noted in the home data: the CO percentage
for girls was 27% and boys 16%. No such difference exists between
the all-girl and all-boy teams at school. Boys tended to focus
their attention on particular activities (including COs) for longer
periods. Girls during a comparable time period spread their attention
more evenly between all available activities. This result requires
further investigation.
<H2>FINDABILITY INDEX FOR COs</H2>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Students using CoF did not find all COs. Most
of the findability analysis of COs is based on the home data since
children in this setting were less restricted by time, by school
work norms, and the research schedules for problem levels, and
got no assistance from peers.</FONT>
<P>
Children in the home study found from 85 to 125 of the 133 entertainment
COs. More than 70% of the COs were found by all children. Six
COs were found by only 2 children, and only one student found
2 of the COs. The time spent looking for COs is highly correlated
(0.82) with the number of COs found (although most of this time
was spent revisiting COs, rather than looking for new ones). 
<P>
This index ranges from 0 to 1. The average CO findability index
for the school teams was 0.47 with a standard deviation of 0.2.
This is considerably less than the average home study value of
0.8 (s.d. 0.2).
<P>
COs have characteristics which contribute to their findability.
From greatest to least, findability varies by type (distinct objects,
distinct regions, parts of objects, and parts of regions), by
animate likelihood (likely animate objects, likely inanimate objects,
regions), and position (centre, periphery). Additional data and
methods of analysis are being investigated to quantify these observations.
<P>
Mouse click data in log files was mapped to create graphic overlays
for each scene. These visual representations were used to explore
clicking patterns. Using this technique it was found, for example,
that the most tenacious child at home had a 71% hit rate in one
scene. Further analyses of success rate is being undertaken.
<P>
Findability should be considered at the design stage of edutainment,
especially if a CO is to carry essential information or directions.
<H2>POPULARITY INDICES FOR COs</H2>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>We have investigated three basic scales for
popularity.</FONT>
<P>
The first two indexes range from 1 to _, and the third ranges
from 0 to 1.
<P>
The Pop1 value for the all COs in CoF is 2.7, s.d. 1.7, range
1-16. Overall Pop3 is 0.63, range 0.0-0.94. The Pop2 value for<B>
</B>the 91<B> </B>single response COs is 1.7 with a standard deviation
of 0.8, ranging from 1 to 4.7. The Pop2 measure for the 42 multiple
response COs is 2.9, s.d. 2.4, range 1.1 to 12.8. The most popular
COs in all but one scene are multiple response COs. Multiple response
COs, on average, have a higher popularity index than single response
COs.
<P>
We are exploring the relationship between CO popularity and entertainment
characteristics of media and message. From the data related to
the popular COs in each scene, children enjoy most the COs with
humor and appropriate multi-media effects and normally enjoy least
attempts to impart COs with strictly verbal information (no visual
aids). Stock figures, which are relatively unchanged throughout
several scenes, become less popular as children navigate more
deeply into the program. For example, in the first two consecutive
scenes Pop1 for the dog Frank, falls from 2.3 to 1.6. Pop3 falls
from 0.56 to 0.37.
<H2>EFFECTIVENESS INDICES FOR MULTIPLE-RESPONSE COs</H2>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Over one-third of the COs have from 2 to 7
multiple responses, <B>MR</B>. Although MR-COs are reinitialized
upon entering a scene, the pattern varies: cycling (abab...),
terminating (abc stop), or idling (abcc...). Considerable resources
were invested by the developer on MR-COs that were revisited by
a small percentage of the teams/students in the study. In fact
only 6 of the 42 MR-COs were fully utilized by most of the teams/students
who found them. On the other hand, an effective MR-CO in CoF was
a row of four baseballs; each gives an individual response and
then disappears. Its findability was just 0.55 but its popularity
was 9.5. Further indices are being devised that measure the effectiveness
and cost-benefit of MR-COs.</FONT>
<H2>RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH</H2>
<P>
<FONT COLOR=#000000>Clearly, COs are a motivating factor in many
edutainment programs. They may be more than entertaining diversions,
and serve a useful psychological function as a bridge between
more substantial activities. Designers of both the entertainment
and educational aspects of edutainment should keep in mind the
concepts, results, and characteristics related to findability,
success rate, popularity and multi-response effectiveness. E-GEMS
will continue to document and refine its micro-analysis of COs,
as well as of navigation, activity patterns, and program features.</FONT>
