The present study assesses user perceptions of current voice mail
systems and identifies desirable traits that should be incorporated
in future agent-based products. Both novices and experts ascribed
similar personality traits to voice mail user interfaces: practical,
intelligent, courteous, efficient, straight-forward, sophisticated,
methodical, progressive and alert. Surprisingly, significantly
more experts desired a more imaginative personality than novices.
Moreover, 20% of the experts did not associate imaginative with
voice mail systems tested. The results suggest that future voice
mail user interface for experts should project an imaginative
quality.

<P>
<B><A NAME="intro">INTRODUCTION</A></B> 
<P>
An essential part of an effective and desirable interface is the
ability to communicate with the user in a constructive dialogue.
Recent research found that users preferred interfaces with personalities
similar to their own (i.e. dominant users prefer dominant interfaces)
[<A HREF="#6">6</A>]. Users rated the application as more competent when the personality
of the user and the interface are consonant. The user interface
must project a system image that the user can understand conceptually.
A poor match between the user interface design and the user's
conceptual model of telephony will limit the understanding of,
use of and satisfaction with telephony applications, particularly
Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) [<A HREF="#2">2</A>].
<P>
In phone-based user interfaces, there is an imbalance in the user
interactions with many Interactive Voice Response (IVR) and voice
mail systems. IVRs present lengthy voice prompts or audio menus
that restrict user responses to a series of touch-tone key presses.
These interfaces lack the natural conversational flow found when
human secretaries take messages or route calls. Recently, voice
processing platforms have incorporated speech recognition capabilities
and the metaphor of a secretary as a means to engage the user
in a more conversational style interface. Moreover, the system's
image of a secretary would be reinforced by projecting a distinctive
personality. Some contend that an anthropomorphic agent should
have the personality of &quot;someone you'd like to work with&quot;
rather than the &quot;unctuous clingy feel&quot; found in current
IVRs [<A HREF="#4">4</A>]. Rather than rely on ancedotal evidence or intuitive
judgments that are poorly articulated, studies should be conducted
to systematically determine personality attributes of current
voice mail systems.
<P>
Before designing new agent-based user interfaces, it is important
to assess the user perceptions of current systems and identify
desirable traits that should be incorporated in future products.
The present study addresses two questions:
<UL>
<LI>Which personality traits do experts and novices attribute
to current voice mail user interfaces?
<LI>Which personality traits do experts and novices desire in
voice mail systems?
</UL>
<HR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="method"> METHODS<A/></B> 
<P>
Two groups, 25 novices and 25 experts, performed nine tasks:
<OL>
<LI>Creating a list
<LI>Editing a list
<LI>Recording greetings
<LI>Listening to new messages
<LI>Reviewing saved messages
<LI>Forwarding messages
<LI>Replying to messages
<LI>Scheduling delivery
<LI>Sending messages
</OL>

<P>
After completing these tasks, respondents described the &quot;personality&quot;
of the voice mail system by rating it with 84 different traits
on a scale from 1 to 7 [<A HREF="#5">5</A>].  For example, if respondents thought
the system was very intelligent, they assigned a seven. If they
did not judge it as very intelligent, they assigned a one. If
the trait was not applicable, no rating was associated with the
trait. Next, participants selected 10 of the traits that they
felt were desirable attributes for a voice mail system, including
those traits that were deemed not applicable to the system tested.
One novice did not rate the voice mail system. Another novice
rated the voice mail system but did not select any of the traits
as desirable.<HR>

<P>
<B><A NAME="results">RESULTS AND DISCUSSION<A/></B> 
<P>
Respondents selected 45 different traits as desirable for voice
mail systems. Both experts and novices shared 9 of the 10 top
desirable traits for a voice mail system. The top five traits
(practical, intelligent, courteous, efficient, straight-forward)
were desirable among more than half of the respondents (See Table
1). Previous research found these traits to be positive characteristics
along likableness and desirability dimensions [<A HREF="#1">1</A>,<A HREF="#3">3</A>].
<P>
Of the 10 most frequently selected traits, experts and novices
differed on one pair of traits in which 40% of the experts selected
imaginative as a desirable trait compared to 16% of the novices,
<I>X2</I>(1)=10.28, p&lt;.05. Surprisingly, 20% of the experts
and 4% of the novices indicated that imaginative as not applicable
to the voice mail system they used but selected imaginative as
a desirable trait in voice mail. Both novice and expert associative
ratings of imaginative were significantly lower than the overall
mean ratings across the top 10 desirable traits (mean=5.22, SD=1.71),
<I>t</I>(10)=2.61, p&lt;.05. The results suggest that voice mail
user interfaces need to be more imaginative.
<P>
Future investigations should explore how a more imaginative personality
can be incorporated into voice mail systems. In addition, more
work needs to be done to determine how users could benefit from
imaginative personalities.<HR>
