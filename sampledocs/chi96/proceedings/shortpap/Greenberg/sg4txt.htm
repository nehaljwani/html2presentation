<H2>ABSTRACT </H2>
TurboTurtle is a animated multi-user microworld that children
use to explore concepts in Newtonian physics. It is a groupware
system where students, each on their own computer, can simultaneous
control the microworld and gesture in a shared view. Observations
of pairs of young children using TurboTurtle highlight extremes
in collaboration styles, from conflict to smooth interaction.

<H2>Keywords </H2>
Computer supported collaborative learning, microworlds.

<H2>INTRODUCTION </H2>
Microworlds [3] are computer simulations of restricted environments
that promote exploratory learning by children. TurboTurtle (Figure
1) is a microworld that simulates a Newtonian universe [1]. Students
explore physical concepts by adjusting properties such as gravity,
friction, force, and velocity. They immediately see the effects
of these changes on the behavior of a turtle (a ball) that moves
through the world. What makes TurboTurtle intriguing is that it
is group-aware. Small co-located or distributed groups can talk
about the simulation while they are manipulating it. Each student
has their own computer screen and input devices. They share the
same view of the simulation, have telepointers to facilitate gesturing,
and can simultaneously manipulate any aspect of the microworld [1]. 

<P>We wanted to see how children managed, or mismanaged, their collaboration
in this environment that not only allowed parallel activity, but
that made no attempt to structure turn-taking or mediate conflicting
actions.

<H2>METHOD</H2>
Twelve children, aged ten or eleven, used the system in mixed
sex pairs for 30 minutes. They were observed through think-aloud
and constructive interaction techniques. Children were seated
approximately two meters apart with a clear view of each other.
They were assigned tasks that familiarized them with TurboTurtle
as a collaborative tool, and that progressively introduced the
Newtonian concepts of friction, gravity, mass and force.

<H2>OBSERVATIONS AND RESULTS </H2>
The children had fun. None left their machine to work directly
with their partner on a single machine. Eye contact was rare,
but during breakdowns it was common for one child to quickly glance
at their partner, without reciprocation. These observations indicate
the overall success of TurboTurtle as a shared microworld.

<P>Collaboration styles varied greatly. The summary in Table 1 shows
that different pairs talked to each other in quite different ways,
and that they manipulated the microworld using various collaboration
styles. These are described next.

<H3>Collaboration styles </H3>
<I><B>Parallel activity. </B></I>Pairs two and five continually
discussed their actions and managed their collaborations simultaneously
and successfully. As part of this, they were vocal about the undesired
actions of their partners. For instance, the boy in pair 2 closed
off a rocket control without prior warning. The girl turned to
the boy and scolded him with "You aborted the mission!"

<P><I><B>Sequential activity. </B></I>Pair three negotiated control
to the near exclusion of simultaneous activity. For example, when
asked to set the rocket controls, the girl said "You set
the heading, then I'll set the fuel and force. Then you can launch
the rocket." The sequence was carried out in that order with
no overlapping of actions, and with an explicit "OK"
once each stage was completed.

Table 1: Predominant collaboration styles
for six pairs of children, aged 10-11 years old.

<P><I><B>Independent activity. </B></I>Pair six almost ignored the
fact that they were in a collaborative microworld. They were mostly
silent despite being encouraged to communicate. They struggled
against the actions of each other, even though the telepointers
revealed the cause of their difficulty. They said it would be
much easier to use the microworld on their own. 

<P><I><B>Domination. </B></I>Breakdowns also occurred when one person
dominated the interaction. In pair one, the boy changed the simulation
properties so rapidly that the girl could not keep pace. The girl
initially took her hands away from the mouse, clearly attempting
to follow the frenetic activity of her partner. Shortly afterwards
she shouted "Leave it!" While the boy briefly capitulated,
he continued to dominate the session, grabbing the controls whenever
the girl hesitated.

<H3>Breakdowns </H3>
Breakdowns happened even in successful collaborations. Yet many
were positive contributions to the overall interaction, with the
breakdown becoming a focal point for children negotiating their
next manipulation of the microworld. Two factors mitigated breakdown:
conversation and mutual awareness.

<P><I><B>Conversation. </B></I>Successful breakdowns were distinguished
from unsuccessful ones by the extent of discussion that accompanied
the conflict. For instance, pair two argued over the desired mass
of the turtle, set by a slider. Their short conflict was accompanied
by comments such as "Make it 20!", "No! Make it
30!". Note that the conflict stems from the task, rather
than the interface. In contrast, pair six encountered the same
problem of simultaneous access to a slider, but it was not clear
to them whether the values that they were trying to set were the
same or different, the confusion being caused by their total silence.

<P><I><B>Mutual awareness. </B></I>While conflicts over the simultaneous
access of sliders were frequent, children were aware of the problem
because they saw the two telepointers on the slider as well as
the bouncing slider position as both tried to move it. They can
then repair the conflict through their natural social skills,
much as they do in the real world. This did not always happen.
In some cases the children were tenacious in their desire to be
last one in control, even though they were well aware of the cause
of the problem. This problem arose because of their own immaturity
at negotiating control. 

<P>Still, the importance of mutual awareness to resolve conflict
was emphasized by two bugs. First, in one part of TurboTurtle
telepointers are not visible. Frustrated comments such as "Hey,
how did that happen!" and "What are you doing?"
were frequent. Next, some parts of TurboTurtle did not show exactly
the same view e.g., pull-down menu actions are not shared, and
two pairs said they wanted to be able to see their partner's menu
selections. These small breakdowns indicate the importance of
keeping aware of another's activities in the microworld.

<H2>DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY </H2>
Collaborations worked when children negotiated their interactions,
and used mutual awareness and breakdowns to further their discussions.
They were less effective when children dominated one another,
ignored each other, or fought for control of microworld objects.
Yet unlike other microworlds, these problems did not arise because
children shared a single input device and display. We agree with
Cole [2], who interprets children's control of their collaborations
in the microworld to be a social process developed through their
own group dynamics. The implication is that groupware microworlds
should give children both the freedom to explore the simulation
at their own pace and personal style, while adding appropriate
structure to minimize the risk of detrimental breakdown that occurs
because children are immature collaborators.
