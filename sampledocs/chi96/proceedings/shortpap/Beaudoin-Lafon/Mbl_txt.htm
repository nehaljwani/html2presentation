<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>

Sheppard-Risset tones are sounds that seem to go up (or 
down) indefinitely. We have designed an "elevator" sound 
based on this auditory illusion and have implemented it in 
the ENO audio system. The sound is synthesized in real-
time and can be controlled in real-time through high-level 
parameters. We have used this sound for audio feedback 
when scrolling and for monitoring the progress of long 
system operations.<P>

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
As our screens become more and more crowded, we need to 
develop alternative ways to convey information to users. 
We are investigating the use of non-speech audio cues to 
provide feedback about user actions, notification of system's 
state changes, and awareness of other users' actions [<A HREF="#ref1">1</A>].<P>

Our approach structures the sound space using a set of 
organizing concepts useful to application designers. This 
approach builds on Gaver's auditory icons [<A HREF="#ref4">4</A>] and, to a 
lesser extent, on Blattner's earcons [<A HREF="#ref2">2</A>]. It contrasts with 
most uses of sound in today's user interfaces, which play 
pre-recorded audio clips. In order to make it easier for 
applications to include audio cues, we have developed the 
ENO audio system [<A HREF="#ref1">1</A>]. ENO is based on the concept of 
sound sources that produce sound when subjected to an 
interaction. For example, a machine source produces sound 
when it is started, and an object source produces sound 
when it is hit or scraped. The sounds are generated in real-
time and can be controlled in real-time by high-level 
parameters such as machine speed or object material.<P>

We believe that auditory illusions have an interesting 
potential for user interaction. Like visual illusions, they 
exploit imperfections in our perceptual systems. For 
example, a common visual illusion in computer graphics 
consists of generating an animation by displaying a series 
of fixed images. In this paper we introduce the use of an 
auditory illusion known as Sheppard-Risset tones to convey 
the idea of motion in the user interface. We first introduce 
Sheppard-Risset tones and then describe how they can be 
used for feedback when interacting with a scrollbar and for 
monitoring the progress of long system operations.<P>

<H2>SHEPPARD-RISSET TONES</H2>

Sheppard-Risset tones [<A HREF="#ref5">5</A>] are sounds that go up (or down) 
indefinitely. They are the auditory equivalent to M.C. 
Escher's famous etching "Ascending and Descending" which 
depicts an endless staircase. Sheppard-Risset tones are made 
of a set of partials whose amplitude is bounded by a bell-
shaped curve (figure 1). Over time, the frequency of each 
partial is shifted upward, while its amplitude is adjusted to 
fit the bell curve. New partials enter the lower end of the 
bell curve while partials reaching the other end of the curve 
disappear. As a result, the overall frequency of the sound is 
constant, but is perceived as going up continuously. 
Descending sounds are created similarly by shifting the 
partials  downward.<P>

Figure 1: a semi-logarithmic plot of the spectrum of a 
Sheppard-Risset tone. Over time, the partials' frequencies 
are shifted upwards.<P> 

Sheppard-Risset tones are controlled by 4 parameters :
<UL>
<li>Base frequency: the center frequency of the bell curve;
<li>Bandwidth:  the ratio between the highest and lowest 
frequencies of the envelope curve;
<li>Speed:  the relative shift in frequency per unit of time. 
The sound is steady when the speed is zero, it moves 
upward when the speed is positive and downward when 
the speed is negative;
<li>Density:  the ratio between the frequencies of successive 
partials. For a given bandwidth, the density determines 
the number of partials.<P>
</UL>

We determined empirically the bounds of the parameters 
necessary to maintain the auditory illusion. Six partials and 
a density around 1.2 give satisfying results. More partials 
actually make the sound richer and more intrusive. With 
these values, the optimal bandwidth is defined by a ratio of 
3 (1 1/2 octave). We also found that the bell curve can be 
approximated with a triangle envelope with no perceivable 
loss in sound quality. This allows for a more efficient 
synthesis algorithm.<P>

<H2>AUDIO FEEDBACK OF MOTION</H2>

We have designed an "elevator" sound based on Sheppard-Risset 
tones and have implemented it in ENO. We call it 
an elevator because it conveys the concept of vertical 
motion and the tone of the sound is not unlike an actual 
elevator. The source has two parameters: the size, bound to 
the base frequency (bigger lifts sound lower), and the speed. 
The bandwidth and density are fixed. We have used this 
"elevator" sound for audio feedback from scrollbars and 
progress bars.<P> 

Scrollbars are used in graphical user interfaces to allow 
users to view large documents through small windows. A 
typical scrollbar has two arrows for incremental moves, a 
thumb (sometimes called an elevator) for direct access and 
two paging areas, between the thumb and the arrows, for 
incremental moves by pages.<P>

The main problem with scrollbars stems from the constant 
shift in attention between two points: the document being 
scrolled, and the scrollbar itself. One specific problem, 
known as kangarooing [<A HREF="#ref3">3</A>], occurs when paging: when the 
thumb is close to the position being clicked in the paging 
area, successive clicks page up and down because the thumb 
jumps around the clicked position. In general, it takes a 
while for users to understand what is happening, especially 
since they are not watching the scrollbar. Another problem 
occurs when the cursor is inadvertently moved out of the 
scrollbar: users do not notice it and get confused when the 
interface does not respond as expected.<P>

The elevator sound solves these problems: whenever the 
cursor is in the scrollbar, a faint sound is played. Its speed 
is zero in the thumb, slow in the arrows and faster in the 
paging areas. This way, users know where they are without 
looking. When clicking or dragging, the sound gets a bit 
louder. If kangarooing occurs, the user is immediately 
notified by the fact that the sound changes direction.<P>

This design has a drawback: it does not provide audio 
feedback of the relative position in the document. We have 
tried to change the base frequency of the sound to reflect the 
position in the document, but this tends to conflict with the 
motion effect. In addition, since most listeners cannot 
recognize absolute pitch, it is not a good idea to use 
frequency to convey an absolute value. This is still an open 
problem.<P>

The second use of the elevator sound is for audio progress 
bars. Progress bars act as a notification mechanism when 
the system is engaged in a long operation, such as copying 
a large file, and the progress of the operation (percent-done) 
is known. The problem with visual progress bars is that 
they need to be looked at to know the progress of the 
operation. Since the operation is long, the user is likely to 
engage in other tasks.<P>

We have used the elevator sound to complement the visual 
display of a progress bar: the speed conveyed by the sound 
reflects the speed of the progression. Therefore, the sound 
conveys the instantaneous speed at which the operation 
progresses rather than the current "percent-done". This way, 
it is very easy to know when the operation stops 
progressing: the sound stops moving. This technique also 
works when the percent-done is not known but the rate of 
progression can be monitored. For example, when 
downloading a document, the Netscape World-Wide Web 
browser displays the current throughput of the connection, 
even if the size of the document is not known. The 
throughput can be mapped to the speed of the lift sound, 
giving an accurate and non-intrusive way to monitor the 
progress of the operation.<P>

<H2>CONCLUSION</H2>

Most objects we use in the real world produce sound when 
being manipulated. However faint, we perceive them and 
they contribute to our representation of the world. 
Computer objects should also produce sound in order to be 
easier to apprehend and manipulate. These sounds need not 
be "natural", as long as they convey useful information. 
Among others, auditory illusions can be used to add 
auditory feedback to interactive applications. We intend to 
build on this work by developing other types of sounds and 
integrating them into ENO.<P>
