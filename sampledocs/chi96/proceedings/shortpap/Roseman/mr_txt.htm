<H2>ABSTRACT </H2>
Teams whose members are in close physical proximity
often rely on team rooms to serve both as meeting places and repositories
of the documents and artifacts that support the team's projects.  TeamRooms
is a prototype groupware system designed to fill the role of a team room
for groups whose members can work both co-located and at a distance.
Facilities in TeamRooms allow team members to collaborate either in
real-time or asynchronously, and to customize their shared electronic space
to suit their needs.

<H2>INTRODUCTION </H2>
Johansen et.  al.  [2] describe how team rooms have
become a central device used by business teams to organize their work.
Team rooms provide a permanent shared space used by the team, serving as a
meeting room, work area, a place to store documents that are needed by the
team's projects, and more generally, as a focus for communication within
the group.

<P>Traditional team rooms rely on the physical proximity of the team
members and their easy access to the room.  We describe here a prototype
groupware system called TeamRooms that supports the team room concept for
teams whose members work either co-located or at a distance.  It combines
aspects of both real-time and asynchronous groupware to provide the team
with a shared electronic space.  The system is highly customizable,
allowing the team to design their electronic room on the fly to suit their
needs, as they do with their physical meeting rooms.

<P>Users run a TeamRooms client that connects over a network to a server
providing a number of rooms.  Each room contains both generic communication
tools (a chat tool and a backdrop acting as a shared whiteboard) and any
number of <I>applets</I> needed to support the group's work.  Typical
applets would be diagramming tools, outliners, brainstorming tools,
browsers for information such as web pages, notes to other team members, as
well as more frivolous items such as card games.  When team members are in
a room at the same time, they see each other's actions both through changes
in the room's artifacts and through mechanisms such as multiple
telepointers.  As with real rooms, all artifacts in the electronic room
persist even when no one is in the room.

<P>TeamRooms is implemented using our groupware toolkit GroupKit [3],
augmented to support centralized processes, user authentication, a
versioned persistence repository, and embedded conferences.  Each applet is
built as a standard GroupKit application, which allowed us to easily move a
number of existing applications into TeamRooms, and to rapidly create new
ones.

<P>
<H2>TEAMROOMS INTERFACE </H2>

Figure 1 illustrates the user interface of the TeamRooms client, where the
user (Carl) is in a room called "Ideas for Papers" with two other users
(Saul and Mark).  Along the bottom of the screen are a text-based chat tool
and different colored pens for drawing on the "walls" of the room (a shared
whiteboard).  Also shown are three applets: a group outliner, a sticky
note, and a URL pointer.

Figure 1.  TeamRooms User Interface, showing (a) radar view of room; (b)
applets; (c) image stills of users in room; (d) telepointer; (e) whiteboard
pens; (f) text-chat area; (g) list of users currently around; (h) list of
rooms.

<P>Each applet is embedded in its own frame, in a similar fashion as
Opendoc or OLE components.  Users select new applets from the Tools menu,
as well as delete, move and resize them.  All changes are immediately
visible to all users in the room.  TeamRooms also keeps a complete version
history for each applet, allowing users to retrieve an earlier version.
This creates a new instance of the applet in the room, allowing comparison
between versions.

<P>Interestingly, TeamRooms has led us to construct several applets that we
would never have considered in conventional groupware.  For example, one
tool allows inserting a pointer to outside information (a URL, which can be
changed by any user), which when selected will invoke a user's World Wide
Web browser.  Another tool contains a pointer (again as a URL) to an image
to be displayed in the room.  This allows a team to create a room by
importing or referring to relevant outside information (or at least
information of interest; our most common image was the daily Dilbert
comic).

<P>TeamRooms also provides several facilities for maintaining awareness of
other team members.  The two windows on the right of Figure 1 show who is
around and in which rooms they are working.  Within the current room, its
participants are always visible.  Telepointers show users' fine-grained
activities.  Because rooms can be larger than a user's window, the radar
view shows a miniature of the room, indicating the position of applets
(dark boxes) as well as other users' views into the room (light stippled
boxes).

<P>
<H2>RELATED WORK </H2>

Conventional real-time groupware systems often focus on a "meeting" or
"session".  Such systems support distributed teams through isolated
activities (e.g.  a shared whiteboard session), but provide limited and
heavyweight support for other team activities.  In contrast, asynchronous
groupware (such as workflow or email) often does not support real-time
activities.  Neither are successful at providing the overall collaboration
support offered by conventional team rooms.

<P>A popular class of systems that parallel the team rooms idea are
Multi-User Dungeons (MUDs).  Traditional MUDs are text-based systems where
users connect to a central server.  Once connected, they enter any number
of different rooms, chat with other users in those rooms, and create and
modify artifacts in the rooms.  Though primarily used socially, MUDs have
been used to support collaborative work, though their text-only
presentation has proved limiting.

<P>We are not unique in trying to provide more sophisticated media in
shared electronic spaces.  The Jupiter system [1] augments a traditional
MUD (LambdaMOO) with audio/video conferencing tools and shared whiteboards.
The wOrlds system [4] also supports audio/video conferencing as well as
numerous other tools.  TeamRooms is most similar to wOrlds, but is more
lightweight, does not directly support audio or video (though it could be
extended to do so), and emphasizes applets more suitable for real-time
collaboration.

<P>
<H2>CONCLUSIONS </H2>

TeamRooms is a prototype groupware system combining the rich applications
and interfaces of real-time groupware tools with the persistence and work
context provided by MUDs.  The result is a system providing the electronic
equivalent of a team room for co-located or distributed work groups.  Our
early usage experiences with TeamRooms are quite encouraging, and we have
found that it does afford many of the same behaviors seen when teams share
a physical space.
