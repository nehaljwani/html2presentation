<H2>ABSTRACT </H2>
Participants in a real-time groupware conference require a sense
of awareness about other people's interactions within a large
shared workspace. Fisheye views can afford this awareness by assigning
a focal point to each participant. The fisheye effect around these
multiple focal points provides peripheral awareness by showing
people's location in the global context, and by magnifying the
area around their work to highlight interaction details. An adjustable
magnification function lets people customize the awareness information
to fit their collaboration needs. A fisheye text editor illustrates
how this can be accomplished.

<H2>INTRODUCTION </H2>
Real-time distributed groupware typically provides a shared virtual
workspace where people can see and manipulate work artifacts.
Many systems now follow a relaxed &quot;what-you-see-is-what-I-see&quot;
(<EM>relaxed-WYSIWIS</EM>) model, where people can have different
viewports into the workspace. The problem is that groupware workspaces
do not yet afford the richness of interaction available in their
physical counterparts. In particular, it is more difficult to
maintain a sense of <EM>workspace awareness</EM>: the up-to-the-minute
knowledge about another person's interactions with the shared
workspace [1]. In groupware, people's normal mechanisms for tracking
what goes on around them, such as peripheral vision and quick
glances, are ineffective since the required information may be
absent from the display. People can lose the sense of awareness
that is essential for coordinating interaction, such as where
others are operating and what they are doing. 

<P>One solution supplies users with two separate windows: a full
sized viewport, and a <EM>radar overview</EM> that presents an active
miniature of the workspace. Radar views typically overlay boxes
atop the miniature to indicate other participant's viewport [1].
However, radar views introduce a seam between local and global
contexts. To gather awareness information, people must attend
to and mentally integrate two displays that differ in both scale
and physical location. As well, the actions shown in the miniature
may not be useful due to the loss of resolution and detail. 

<P>Applying fisheye visualization techniques to groupware can remove
this seam. In conventional fisheye systems, multiple focal points
magnify regions of personal interest within the global context
[3]. A groupware fisheye twists this notion by assigning a focal
point to each participant. Consequently, a person's view into
the shared workspace will contain magnified regions showing others'
work areas, seamlessly integrated into the global context. These
regions provide awareness of the details of others' actions. If
the magnification function is adjustable, a person can even customize
the awareness information to suit their particular collaboration
needs in the shared workspace.

<P>
<H2>A FISHEYE TEXT EDITOR USED BY ONE PERSON </H2>

A fisheye view is a visualization technique that provides both
local detail and global context in a single display. It takes
its name from camera lenses that distort a scene to provide very
wide angles of view. In a computational fisheye, the user chooses
one or more points of focus where they wish to see local detail
[3]. These areas are visually emphasized, with the surrounding
regions de-emphasized by graphical scaling, filtering, or clustering.

<P>The editor in Figure 1 uses a fisheye lens to present a text document.
Most of the text is shown at a very small font, which gives the
person a sense of the document's global structure. The user views
local detail by selecting a focal point in the document with the
mouse or scrollbar. Fisheye effects are customized through a novel
<EM>lens widget</EM>-users can resize the background text, and modify
the shape of the lens that magnifies text around their focal point.

<H2>A GROUPWARE FISHEYE TEXT EDITOR </H2>

<P>While valuable for single-user information visualization, fisheye
views can be extended to support workspace awareness in groupware
as well. The fisheye text editor above is actually a groupware
application constructed in a groupware toolkit [2]. As groupware,
the editor lets multiple people view the same document. People
join into it through a session manager (Figure 2, top right).
Although the same document is visible on all displays, views are
relaxed-WYSIWIS: each person can set their own focal point and
customize the fisheye effect.

<P>Support for workspace awareness involves representing each participant's
focus in the document. First, location information and user identification
is presented by marking others' focal points with an assigned
color. Second, the text around other participants' focal points
is also magnified. Figure 2 shows three focal points with corresponding
magnified regions; the center region belongs to the user and the
surrounding two represent the other participants. Their locations
in the global context and the details of their work are clearly
visible.

<P>As people move between loosely and tightly coupled collaborations,
their awareness requirements will change. Because display space
is at a premium, a person should be able to allocate screen space
for their own work or for the display of awareness information,
as required. In the fisheye editor, a person can customize the
amount of awareness detail by altering the magnification function
applied to others' focal points, by changing the background magnification,
and by linking their views. 

<UL>
<LI>If only location information is desired, one can turn off
the magnification of other participants' focal points. Others'
locations remain visible through color, but no extra screen space
is used.

<LI>For finer-grained awareness, the detail visible can be progressively
increased by growing the magnification around the other participant's
focus, as well as the extent of the region being magnified. 

<LI>When people are working far apart in the document, a &quot;split
window&quot; effect can bring them closer together. The background
font is made invisible, thus displaying only the regions surrounding
each focal point. 

<LI>For tightly-coupled collaboration, people can link their views,
which lets all participants share a common focal point. If any
user changes the focus, it will be changed on all other displays
as well.

<H2>DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY </H2>

There is more to awareness than knowing other's location and actions,
and an appraisal of the fisheye editor against an awareness framework
[1] has identified other requirement that need to be addressed.
For example, because people need to be aware of others' movements
and gestures in the workspace, we have added telepointers to the
system. We also need a better way of identifying who belongs to
a given focal point, as color is not a particularly good cue.
However, the basic fisheye concept seems sound. 

<P>We believe that fisheye views are a good approach to help people
maintain workspace awareness. This remains to be confirmed by
user-based studies.
