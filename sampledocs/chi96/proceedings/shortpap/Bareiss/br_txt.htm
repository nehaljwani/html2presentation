<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>
<P>
This paper describes ASK Jasper, a hypermedia performance support
system that provides a structured work environment and in-context
help and advice to students as they learn the concepts and skills
of empirical geometry through solving a complex design problem.

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>
Corporate training is in the midst of a paradigm shift from the
current practice of training workers prior to performing a task
to performance support while they are performing it. This shift
is being driven by rapid and constant changes in job roles and
technology; training simply cannot keep up with the demands of
the workplace [1]. A performance support system combines tools
and knowledge resources designed to enable performance by providing
a work context aligned to the worker's task and pre-existing skills.
Support is provided by mechanisms that present and structure information,
advice, and other resources at the moment of need to reduce the
amount of job knowledge that must be internalized to perform the
task [2].
<P>
Modern theories of education advocate situating the instruction
of even young students in problem-based, learn-by-doing curricula
(e.g., [3,4]). Given this position, it is natural to ask if performance
support technology can be adapted to provide support for students,
not just to meet <I>performance goals</I>, but also to meet <I>learning
goals</I>. There is, of course, a fundamental difference between
the two situations: Performance support for practitioners focuses
on achieving results and efficiency. In contrast, performance
support for learners emphasizes supporting students as they acquire
new skills and knowledge.
<H2>ASK JASPER</H2>
<P>
ASK Jasper is a computer-based hypermedia environment designed
to support middle school students as they learn empirical geometry
in the course of solving a complex design problem. Their problem
is to design a playground subject to a number of requirements
and constraints imposed by safety considerations and by limited
resources.<BR>
<P>
To do this successfully, students must use empirical geometry
to create their designs and must communicate them to others by
constructing scale drawings.
<P>
General guidance is provided by a goal/subgoal task model of the
design process. This structures students' problem solving by helping
them keep track of where they are in the problem space and provides
cues when they do not know what to do next. It is up to the students
to track their progress, i.e., which steps they have completed
and what remains to be done. At the highest level, the model guides
the students to understand the problem, to design one or more
components, to integrate the components into an overall design,
to execute the design, and to reflect on the success of the design
and what has been learned. Each of these high-level goals is,
in-turn, broken down into subgoals. The student may iterate through
them several times as a design is created and revised.
<P>
While it provides an overall structure, such a task model does
not provide sufficient procedural guidance for some students.
Therefore, brainstorming questions are associated with each of
the subtasks to provide ideas on how to go about solving the design
problem, e.g., by breaking the problem down into subproblems,
using expert design heuristics, evaluating work in progress, and
reflecting on what has been learned. These heuristics are not
specific to the playground design problem. With minor modifications,
they can be applied to any design problem.
<P>
A student in difficulty may not receive sufficiently specific
assistance from the task model and the associated brainstorming
questions. Therefore, a performance support database of example
designs (cf. [1]) with accompanying rationales and procedural
guidance is provided as a design resource. This database contains
actual designs of pieces of playground equipment and layouts that
are offered as solutions to the design problem. While designing
ASK Jasper, we worried about providing such examples, rather than
providing examples by analogy to other design tasks. We decided
to provide direct examples because we felt that less successful
students would have difficulty in transferring the associated
procedures and issues across domains.
<P>
However, because our goal is to support students as they learn
about math and design in the context of creating a design themselves,
we did not want to provide designs and other information that
could simply be copied. Therefore, the database is populated with
imperfect examples - examples that are substantially correct,
but do not meet the requirements and constraints of the problem.
A student must recognize and correct these discrepancies if he
or she is to reuse the design successfully. Eventually, the database
will contain many example designs that span the range of naive
conceptions of the design problem and related mathematical concepts.
Studying multiple designs, may assist students in recognizing
and avoiding imperfections in their designs.
<P>
As noted, the database contains much more than example designs.
It utilizes the ASK methodology for creating structured hypermedia
systems [5] to augment each example design with several additional
categories of information:
<UL>
<LI><B>How To</B> contains notes describing procedures which were
used in creating the design.
<LI><B>Why</B> provides design rationale.
<LI><B>Big Picture</B> records the design context (e.g., requirements
and constraints on a design).
<LI><B>Details</B> provides detailed sub-designs.
<LI><B>Other Examples</B> provides links to alternatives.
<LI><B>Learning Issues</B> contains notes about open issues and
evaluations by the designer, peers, and the teacher.
</UL>
<P>
Notes in the database can be graphics, text, or digital video,
as appropriate to what is being conveyed. Taken together, a sequence
of notes comprises a design episode, whose components are indexed
by the task model.
<P>
The student creates and documents his or her design in a separate
database that has a structure identical to that of the performance
support database. Design notes are created using a simple word
processor built into the database and any commonly available graphics
and video programs. Alternatively, designs can be created on paper
and input via a scanner. Because both databases are indexed by
a common task model, the system can generally track the student's
progress and provide access to relevant examples on request. After
the student's design has been completed, evaluated, and revised,
it is published into the performance support database for use
by others. The student can use hypermedia linking facilities to
link his or her design notes to notes which were relevant to its
creation.
<H2>PERFORMANCE SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS VS. PRACTITIONERS</H2>
<P>
While ASK Jasper has significant commonalties with performance
support systems that are being constructed in industry for practitioners,
its pedagogical intent gives rise to significant differences in
four areas:
<P>
<B>1. Building knowledge vs. creating products</B>: The economic
demands of the workplace require practitioners to be productive,
even while learning. In contrast, knowledge and skills <I>are</I>
the products of a student's work. Reflecting this different emphasis,
ASK Jasper does not provide some of the tools that would be provided
to a practitioner. For example, we could automate many of the
key mathematical tasks, such as the calculation of perimeter,
area, and volume or the creation of dimensioned scale drawings.
However, one of the primary curricular objectives is to have students
acquire these skills while using them in a realistic context.
<P>
<B>2.</B> <B>Differences in pre-existing knowledge. </B>We expect
the student to bring less knowledge and experience to bear on
problems than practitioners, so the procedural help tends to be
much more basic. Very specific help is possible because the student
is solving a known problem.
<P>
<B>3. Database Contents and Use:</B> In the ideal case, a practitioner
will find an example in the database that matches his or her needs
exactly and simply be able to copy it to solve a new problem.
In contrast, we want a student to generate a solution. Therefore,
examples in the student database are not directly applicable,
so that they cannot be copied without modification to solve the
new problem; at a minimum the student must understand the requirements
and constraints of the design problem and how a design fails to
meet them, and he or she must adapt the design to do so.
<P>
<B>4. Adding to Group Memory:</B> A primary goal of the student
is to add to the database of design examples. The task of articulating
what has been learned has important cognitive consequences and
is highly motivational. In contrast, the practitioner is focused
on task performance and is likely to view the entry of information
into the archive as a distraction. <BR>
<H2>CURRENT STATUS</H2>
<P>
ASK Jasper is fully implemented, as described, and we are currently
engaged in user testing with a group of middle school students
of mixed abilities. Based on the results of these tests, the software
will be revised, and we plan to use ASK Jasper in two middle school
math classes this spring.
