We are interested in prototyping future computing environments. In
this paper, we present the Cyberguide project, which is building
prototypes of handheld, intelligent tour guides that provide
information to a tourist based on knowledge of position and
orientation. We will describe features of existing Cyberguide
prototypes and discuss important research issues that have emerged in
context-aware applications development in a mobile environment.<p>

<H3><A NAME="HDR2">Introduction</A></H3>

An alluring vision for the future of computing environments is that
someday the interface will follow the user, and not vice versa. This
vision is fueled by corporate concept videos suggesting this future is
only years away from realization and the arrival of affordable mobile
computing infrastructure. Yet we see few attempts to build convincing
applications of ubiquitous and mobile computing upon this growing
infrastructure. In this paper, we will describe the Cyberguide project
at Georgia Tech. Cyberguide is one of a number of projects at Georgia
Tech exploring visions of the future using existing technology.<p>

The challenge we are addressing in Cyberguide is how to build mobile
applications that usefully leverage off of information about the
context of the user. Initially, we are concerned with only a small
part of the user's context, specifically location and
orientation. Cyberguide provides a position-aware handheld tour guide
for directing visitors around the GVU Lab during our monthly open
houses. <p>

Visitors to a GVU open house are typically given a map of the various
labs and an information packet describing all of the projects that are
being demonstrated at various sites. In building Cyberguide, we wanted
to support the tasks of the visitor to the GVU open house. Collapsing
all of the paper-based information into a handheld intelligent tour
guide that knew where you were, what you were looking at and could
answer typical visitor questions provides a testbed for research
questions on mobile, context-aware application development.<p> We have
used Cyberguide on several occasions to date and have collected some
usability data to aid in future designs. A screen dump from an initial
prototype done using the Newton Message Pad is shown in <A
HREF="#Figure1">Figure 1</A>.<p>

In thinking about and developing a location-aware application, we were
greatly influenced by the work on the PARCTab at Xerox PARC <A
HREF="#REF73805">[3]</A>, the InfoPad project at Berkeley <A
HREF="#REF96497">[1]</A> and the Olivetti Active Badge system <A
HREF="#REF26173">[2]</A>. <p>

We wanted to build useful applications that might take advantage of
the hardware developed in the PARCTab and InfoPad projects. There are
a number of commercially available and relatively inexpensive handheld
units that would suffice for our purposes, such as the Newton, a
MagicCap machine or a pen-based PC.<p>

For positioning, we considered the Active Badge system, but rejected
it for reasons of cost and long-term objectives. The Active Badge
system combines position detection with communication. For room-level
granularity of position, this is reasonable since the communications
range is on par with the position resolution. With Cyberguide, we
chose to separate the wireless communications capabilities from the
positioning system, so we could seek out more cost-effective solutions
for both.<p>

<H3><A NAME="HDR4">The Design of Cyberguide</A></H3>

Since Cyberguide is a rapidly evolving prototype, it has been designed
with change in mind. The architecture of Cyberguide consisted of four
independent components---the map, the information base, the
positioning system and the communications system---each of which will
change significantly from prototype to prototype.<p>


The map is the view the visitor is using to navigate. Visualizing and
manipulating the map dominates the user interface of Cyberguide. It
can be viewed at varying levels of detail and scrolled around. The
visitor is indicated by location and orientation on the map (the
arrowhead in <A HREF="#Figure1">Figure 1</A>) and various
demonstrations are also marked (as stars in <A HREF="#Figure1">Figure
1</A>). <p>

Information on a demonstration is revealed by an explicit pen touch on
the map or by wandering &quot;close&quot; to a demo. Touching the name
of the demo will move the user in hypertext fashion to an information
space component (not shown in <A HREF="#Figure1">Figure 1</A>) that
describes relevant information on the project and people associated
with that particular demonstration.<p>

The positioning component provides constantly updated information on
the location and orientation of the tourist. Our current prototype
implements indoor positioning via a collection of TV remote control
beacons broadcasting separate location IDs. When within range of a
beacon, a custom IR transceiver unit (consisting of a separate IR
sensor and a Motorola 68332 processor connected via serial port to the
Newton) translates the ID into a map location and orientation. the
additional processor unit allows for further customized extensions to
the positioning system, such as an electronic compass. Optionally, we
could use the built-in Newton IR transceiver coupled with individual
Newton beacons. This option requires no additional hardware, but is
less flexible.<p>

We have designed an application-level protocol on top of Appletalk to
facilitate communication between the Newton and the Internet. This
communication mechanism permits a user to send e-mail, print
documents, and eventually communicate with other Cyberguide
users. Eventually, we will be able to support wireless Internet
communication and this will greatly reduce the storage demands on the
handheld unit and allow for connectivity to vast information sources,
such as the World-Wide Web.<p>

<H3><A NAME="HDR5">Evaluating and Extending Cyberguide</A></H3>

Within 6 months we have completed 3 major prototypes of Cyberguide and
have tested it with a large number of visitors to the GVU open
houses. Our initial prototypes had very limited positioning
capabilities that did not encourage tourist mobility. The more
sophisticated position/orientation system we now have in place
encourages the tourist to wander around the lab much more, but our
observations are still somewhat colored by the limited space in which
we support Cyberguide positioning. Our next prototype will provide a
tour of a much wider area, the campus of Georgia Tech, substituting
GPS for the IR positioning system.<p>

We also determined from our evaluation of users that we need to
provide greater support to help the tourist find places of interest
and guide them along the right path. This capability existed in the
original prototypes, but was hidden from the tourist. <p>

We can track where the tourist has been in their travels and use that
information to provide better services, such as an automatically
updated log of their visit, or advice on where to find similar
demonstrations to ones that have already been seen. In the limited
confines of the GVU lab, this might not be so important, but in a
large museum or zoo, it would be ideal, especially if coupled with
information about how crowded certain areas are (or whether the
exhibits are currently visible and active).<p>

Viewing a large detailed map on a small screen is a difficult
issue. Much of the current HCI visualization research focuses on
information spaces and not physical spaces. We currently support any
number of discrete zoom levels for viewing a map, but we do not feel
this is the most effective technique for maintaining context. The
current platform for the prototypes makes such visualization research
difficult, but we are already investigating other more open
platforms.<p>

Information depicted on the map is dynamic. Demonstrations sometimes
changed locations during an open house, yet our prototype was unable
to be updated dynamically to reflect this change. We have seen a
similar problem with on-board navigational systems for automobiles
that contain a large but static map of roads. We have two solutions to
this problem which are currently being implemented. The first is to
use the communications infrastructure to dynamically update the
information base. The other approach, more difficult but more
flexible, is to use machine vision to recognize a demonstration at
some location.<p>

<H3><A NAME="HDR6">Conclusions</A></H3>

In the 6 months we have been working on Cyberguide, we have learned
three major lessons. First, we can create cost-effective context-aware
applications with equipment that is readily available. Second, we
learned that absolute positioning information throughout an entire
space is not so important. It is far more useful to know what someone
is looking at than to know someone's exact physical position and
orientation. Rather than uniformly distribute a positioning system
around some physical space, it is more useful to gather detailed
positioning information around objects of expected interest in the
space. Third, we understand why it is better to separate the
positioning system from the communications system. Positioning
information need not be uniformly distributed as discussed above, but
communications services need global coverage of a physical
space. Furthermore, positioning and communication systems have
different characteristics for indoor and outdoor use<p>

Much of the development of Cyberguide was done by undergraduates in
the College of Computing at Georgia Tech, including Ben Buie, Jason
Vermillion, Daniel Bassett, Chris Goodrum, Eugene Liu, Greg Brown,
Nancy Babiarz, LaShonda Davis and Tonja Taylor. Many of the ideas that
inspired Cyberguide came from discussions within the Future Computing
Environments Group, and we would especially like to thank Colleen
Kehoe from that group. We would like to acknowledge the financial
support of Peter Freeman, Dean of the College of Computing, and Dewey
Anderson of BellSouth IntelliVentures. We also thank the local Atlanta
Newton User's Group for their moral and technical support.<p>
