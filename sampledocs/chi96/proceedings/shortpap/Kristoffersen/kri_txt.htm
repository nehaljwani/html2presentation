<a name="RTFToC1">ABSTRACT</a></h1>
This paper considers the effects of video-based communication systems on
individual, local mobility in the everyday, practical `space' of work. Previous
academic research emphasises how video can <i>extend</i and <i>enhance </i>
space. We found, doing a focused ethnography, that video, in a trade-off
between `real' and `virtual' mobility, restricted the use of personal,
workaday, physical space. Issues thus raised for design of video-based systems
are: physical mobility in workaday space during sessions; modal and temporal
switching between different means of communication; individual work during
collective activities; and, alternating between tasks as part of articulating
the work.<b></b>

<a name="RTFToC3">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>
This paper is based on an ethnographic study in a UK bank. The bank is in the
process of introducing a `Video Link' to facilitate communication between
specialists in a Customer Service Centre, and the customers and clerks in the
branches of a major, UK bank. Our research is not an experiment designed by us
to assess the relative efficiency of video. The Customer Service Centre came
into existence as part of an ongoing centralisation effort in the bank, one
response to the perceived globalisation and competitiveness of the industry.
The Video Link is introduced by the bank to reduce the back-log of customer
queries by reducing paperwork and putting the customer in the branch,
`directly' in contact with the specialists.<p>
The introduction of the Video Link has, however, been problematic. The apparent
problem we wish to address, is the ways in which video-based communication
systems reduce the <i>degrees of freedom</i>, logically and physically, for the
users in the Customer Service Centre.  It is not, in this paper, our concern
that the Video Link is potentially obtrusive, or has few mechanisms to ensure
privacy. Our concern is the ways in which video potentially interferes with the
natural, workaday use of the personal, physical space for people whose work is
unpredictably dynamic and mobile.<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>Early work with video defined the `media space' as an electronic
setting in which groups of people could work together, even when they were
geographically or temporally dispersed [5]. A similar research effort was
undertaken by Bellcore, focusing on the `virtual hallways' of media space. <p>

<tt><b><i></i></b></tt><p>
<tt><b><i></i></b></tt>Key concepts are social browsing, proximity and
unplanned interaction [3]. For many researchers in the field, this has become
the equivalent of supporting the ability to meet informally, claiming that this
is a critical aspect of productive group work [2]. Some of these assumptions
have little relevance in the bank  [4].<p>
The research  philosophy that we adopted for the empirical work in the Bank,
was broadly that of `ethnomethodological ethnography'. The distinguishing
characteristic of this approach is the researcher's involvement in the
organisation, describing the circumstances, practices, conversations and
activities that comprise the `real world' character of everyday work settings.
The purpose of such an investigation is to provide a rich understanding of what
takes place in the workplace during an ordinary working day. Since innovation
is our aim, the need for statistical generalisability or in-depth, longitudinal
observation can be relaxed. Albeit based on a single setting, ethnography can
produce `typical' and relevant findings, for practical purposes. Our claim is
that, <i>qua  </i>paper-based open plan office with an intermediate, but
critical level of computerisation, the bank's service centres are typical for
many medium-to-large corporations.
<h1>
<a name="RTFToC4">THE
ETHNOGRAPHY
</a></h1>
The bank's research department employed external consultants to do a series of
training sessions for the sites where video was introduced. In summary, the
specialists involved became increasingly uncomfortable and insecure handling
the `designed-to-be-simple' cases, with the quality of promises and advice
rapidly declining as they became `stuck' in front of the camera. In our
interpretation, the main problem experienced by the users was that the
resources of the ordinary, workaday, space; e.g. colleagues to ask for advice,
managers to decide on exceptional cases (which they almost all turned out to
be, after all), and documentation from the archives, were no longer available
to them because they were `on the air'. The focus on the customer, and knowing
that the customer had been offered the added value of `facing' them, made the
telephone sitting on the desk only 10 inches from them an `invisible' option
for local, point-to-point communication, which is what they would normally use
in similar situations. <p>
In  a `real' use situation, with an actual customer, a similar situation
occurred, confirming our suspicion that the work ordinarily carried out by
`bona fide' competent specialists, require a more elaborate and flexible
interaction management than the Video Link and current division of labour of
which is it part, can offer today. The specialist determined that the case
could not be solved by herself. She explained to the customer what went wrong
(that one of the processing staff forgot to key in the branch's sort code to
override the terminal's default, with the result that all her transactions were
registered on the wrong sort-code). Then, she made an appointment (getting the
telephone number and a convenient time) to contact the customer again once she
had resolved the query. It is also relevant to the constraints and
possibilities within our design space of future applications that the `problem'
is anchored in two different branches. Potentially, the need to contact and
interact with a geographically dispersed even wider group could arise, during
the interview with the customer. <p>
Working without video, the specialists are allocated a set of queries every
morning. The `ideal' day will start by completing the necessary, everyday
routine, followed by query handling. However, because much work is
event-driven, either in the form of customers phoning through on the external
lines or as interruptions from colleagues, most days are, 'typically',
different from this idealised model. Queries often cannot be completed in one
push, simply because other people are involved that cannot be reached. The
manager often needs to sanction decisions made by the specialists. The archives
are consulted frequently because all correspondence and documentation are kept
there, either sorted chronologically, or by customer. A separate VDT terminal
can be queried, asynchronously, for individual transactions yielding reference
numbers, account number, amounts, etc. This essential information is often
missing from query specification. In this environment people are continuously
moving around, discussing cases with each other, particularly and obviously if
the cases relate to special competencies. The point we make is that the
specialists rely on locally and globally dispersed resources, people and
organisations that they, in an eventual role as <i>producers </iof
<i>synchronous</i>, tightly coupled video presentations, would have to access
differently. 
<h1>
<a name="RTFToC5">DISCUSSION
AND IMPLICATIONS
</a></h1>
For most people the ability to move around freely and flexibly in their local
environment is not considered a privilege, but rather a necessity. However,
using the Video Link, this mobility would become restricted. Our work suggests
that designers should critically revisit their models of situated
communication. Below, we discuss four issues that designers of video-based
communication systems should take into consideration ([1] outlines a similar
`design framework approach).  <p>
The first issue, <i>Physical mobility </i>indicates at least two design
considerations: i) What is, and how can the user influence the `scope' of the
camera(s) he or she is using for the `presentation'. ii) In the case of
recording from an open office, who `owns' the (public) devices; controls the
floor as it were, and who determines what is captured and where it is
broadcast. The `floor' needs to be signalled to potential `extras' that might
inadvertently become part of the presentation.  The second issue brought to
attention is the need for <i>modal and temporal switching.</i One possible
requirement (e.g. in a situation where a customer is interviewed and an
`exceptional' issue arises demanding the instantaneous, but brief attention of
a manager) is for the Video Link to allow a second connection to be set up
without dismounting the current. Many applications today do not allow a new
conference to be added to the process that is running. The third design
concern, <i>allowing individual work to be articulated</i is perhaps the
`hardest' to fit into our case from the bank. In some situations it could be
appropriate to share documents in preparation. This proposal was, however,
rejected by the bank's research department in collaboration with user
representatives, simply because `they were sold at the other end as experts'
and didn't feel comfortable about sharing <i>mistakes</iwith customers, in
that context. By adding <i>persistence</i>, e.g. by representing the connection
as an object that could be stored in, a fourth issue of this `design framework'
could be addressed. Instead of starting from scratch, the contact information,
related electronic documents, the quality specification, etc., could be
contained, making  it possible to resume to `conference' where it was
suspended, instead of <i>restarting</i it.
<h1>
<a name="RTFToC6">CONCLUSION</a></h1>
The problem addressed in this paper is that video communication imposes
limitations in the individual, physical space, with reduced degrees of freedom
and inflexible interaction management. The limited ability to manage
interaction across video connections is particularly problematic for the
adoption of video technologies within real world work settings.
