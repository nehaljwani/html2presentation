<A NAME="theme"><font color=red>Common Ground</font></A>
is the theme of CHI 96. For the technical program this means
creating a common base of understanding between all CHI participants.
Practitioners and researchers need to appreciate each other's work and
motives. Students of HCI and educators should be able to speak a common
language. CHI participants from different cultures and continents should
understand one another's concerns for a humane way to design and use
information technology. Users and designers should share a common concern
for usability.
<P>
We are very proud of our CHI 96 
<A NAME="plenary"><font color=red>plenary speakers</font></A>, 
Dr. Herb Clark, a
psycholinguist at Stanford University and Dr. Betty Edwards, Director of
the Center for Educational Applications of Brain Hemisphere Research,
California State University, Long Beach, California. We also have a new
event this year, Invited Contributions, which come from outside the
traditional HCI disciplines. In the spirit of reaching out to find common
ground with new disciplines, we have contributions from cognitive
neuroscience, library science, and modern dance. We also
have a report from the CHIKids' experience with creative childcare. Dr.
Andrew Magpantay of the American Library Association, Dr. Boris
Velichkovsky of Dresden University, Dr. Allison Druin of the University of
New Mexico and Ms. Sang Mah of Simon Fraser University participated in our
invited contributions.
<P>
Another CHI 96 innovation is a 
<A NAME="retro"><font color=red>Preconference Events Retrospective</font></A>.
Workshops, the Doctoral Consortium and the Research Symposium report
highlights of their events.
<P>
This year we provided 
<A NAME="mentor"><font color=red>mentoring help</font></A>
to those not familiar with CHI
traditions. We had some successes with accepted papers!  We hope the
mentoring program will become a regular part of CHI.
<P>
We are working toward making CHI a 
<A NAME="global"><font color=red>global conference</font></a>. 
We have international
coordinators from four continents, a highly international conference
committee and review committees.  The accepted submissions are more
international than ever before.
<P>
This year we updated and freshened the publications format. The templates
are easier to use. We have already had another conference ask our
permission to use our new format, proving once again that imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery (and that news travels fast on the Web).
<P>
In the 
<A NAME="program"><font color=red>Technical Program</font></A>, 
there are twelve different types of activities
(in addition to the Plenary talks and the Invited Contributions). 
<A NAME="papers"><font color=green>Full papers</font></A> are published in the 
Proceedings.  The 
Conference Companion 
contains
<A NAME="short"><font color=green>Short Papers</font></A>, 
<A NAME="poster"><font color=green>Interactive Posters</font></A>, 
<A NAME="social"><font color=green>Social Action Posters</font></A>, 
Workshops, SIGs, Demos, 
<A NAME="video">Videos</font></A>, 
Design Briefings, Panels, Organization Overviews, Research
Symposium and Doctoral Consortium. 
<EM>
The Electronic Proceedings do not make
this distinction, they contain all types of publications.</EM>
<P>
<A NAME="work"><font color=green>Workshops</font></a>
take place prior to the main conference. They bring together
people with a very focused shagreen interest. 
<A NAME="sig"><font color=green>Special Interest Groups (SIGs)</font></A>
provide short meetings during the conference, again centegreen around a
focused shagreen interest.
<P>
<A NAME="demo"><font color=green>Demonstrations</font></a>
enable participants to view systems in action and discuss
them with the people who created them.
<P>
<A NAME="design"><font color=green>Design Briefings</font></a>
present notable user interface designs with special
emphasis on conceptual issues embodied in the designs.
<P>
<A NAME="panel"><font color=green>Panels</font></A>
allow speakers and the audience to reflect on and discuss
provocative HCI issues.
<P>
<A NAME="org"><font color=green>Organization Overviews</font></A> 
provide briefings on the work of organizations
engaged in HCI research and practice.
<P>
The <A NAME="research"><font color=green>Research Symposium</font></A>,
held prior to the main Conference, considers a
range of research issues in HCI.
<P>
The <A NAME="doc"><font color=green>Doctoral Consortium</font></A>, 
held prior to the main Conference,  allows
doctoral students in the final stages of their research projects to
interact with more experienced researchers.
<P>
It has been a pleasure and a privilege to work with our dedicated, talented
Technical Program area chairs. They make this complicated and diverse
conference a reality. Our most heartfelt thanks to them for their
creativity, hard work, tact, and good cheer.
