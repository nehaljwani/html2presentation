<B>ABSTRACT</B><P>
In our project for the Maryland Department of Juvenile 
Justice we are developing new techniques to visualize 
youth records.  By showing multiple timelines with 
selectable markers to retrieve detailed information, 
overviews are always available even for complex records.  
Data can be zoomed and filtered, and related events can 
be highlighted.  We show how this technique can be used 
to visualize medical patient records and other personal 
histories. <P>

<B>INTRODUCTION</B><P>
Records of personal histories are needed in a variety of 
applications. Members of the medical and legal 
professions examine a record to garner information that 
will allow them to make an informed decision regarding 
their patient or case.  Decision making critically depends 
on gleaning the complete story, spotting trends, noting 
critical incidents or cause-effect relationships and 
reviewing previous actions.  While more attention is now 
put on developing standards for gathering and exchanging 
personal records (especially in the medical field), we 
found that virtually no effort had been made to design 
visualization and navigation techniques to present and 
explore personal history records.<P>

Tufte [1] describes timelines as a frequent and powerful 
form of graphic design.  A design using timelines for 
medical records was proposed by Powsner and Tufte [2] 
who developed a graphical summary using a table of 
individual plots of test results and treatment data.  In 
project management Gantt charts and PERT charts display 
the duration and type of tasks in a project but the 
overviews do not provide the richness needed for personal 
histories, which are not carefully planned series of tasks, 
but mosaics of information that contain a variety of events 
and relationships. <P>

<B>JUVENILE JUSTICE YOUTH RECORD</B><P>
We worked with the Maryland Department of Juvenile 
Justice (previously Department of Juvenile Services, a 
named in the video) to design a youth record visualization. 
DJJ is using an information system to process over 50,000 
cases of delinquent youth behavior per year.  With the 
current system cryptic codes are used to access screens 
packed with lists of 
cases, placements or reviews, and to browse complex 
forms while searching for detail information in dozens of 
screens.In response LifeLines was designed to 1) present a 
visual youth record overview on a single screen, 2) 
provide direct access to all detailed information from the 
overview with one or two clicks of the mouse, and 3) 
promote critical information or alerts to the overview 
level.<P>

<B>Description of the interface</B><P>
The facets of the youth record were chosen to be the 
cases, placements, case worker assignments and reviews 
(<a href="cps_fg1.gif">Figure 1</a>).  
Each facet is distinguished from the next by a 
change of background color. The dates on the timeline 
legend show that the youth Bart Simpson has been 
involved with DJJ for about a year.  The first facet of the 
record shows Bart's cases which are indicated by four 
lines.  Bart was first referred to DJJ for "breaking and 
entering" (B&E code). The case was handled informally 
and then closed after 3 months.  He was referred again for 
the same offense, also handled informally and then for a 
more serious auto theft.  That time the case was handled 
formally  (i.e. went to the States Attorney's Office - SAO) 
and Bart was found guilty.  The right end of the timelines 
area shows Bart's current status: we can see that there is 
only one case open, an attempted murder case for which a 
decision has not yet been made.  The placement facet 
shows that Bart is currently at Waxter (a detention 
center), in relation to the attempted murder case.  Last 
year Bart was placed in a drug abuse program for a while 
and later at Cheltenham (a residential treatment center) 
when he was found guilty in the auto theft case. The 
assignment lines show who has worked on Bart's cases.  
Currently, Brown is assigned to Bart.  The last facet is the 
set of reviews which are discrete events where the youth’s 
needs or progress are assessed.  Clicking on a review icon 
displays the review text in an overlapping window.  A 
click on a worker's name gives that worker's contact 
information.  Similarly details about cases or placement 
are obtained by clicking on the lines or labels.<P>

Interrelationships between periods or events on the lines 
can be highlighted.  For example one cannot tell by 
looking at the timelines if the drug abuse program was a 
result of the auto theft case or the breaking and entering 
case, but clicking on the drug abuse program highlights 
the related case (i.e. in this instance the B&E case) and 
the workers assigned.<P>

Line thickness and color can be used to indicate the 
severity of the offense and the depth of penetration in the 
system.  At the top of the screen, a set of buttons provides 
access to Bart's general contact information, aliases used, 
education information, and medical status.  Critical 
keywords from these screens always appear on the 
overview (e. g.  suicide risk).<P>

<B>KEEPING THE OVERVIEW</B><P>
LifeLines always begins with an overview of the entire 
record.  Unfortunately, some youth records include so 
many cases that one page is not enough.  Screen size 
limits the number of lines which can be displayed, and the 
number of events and periods which can be identified on a 
line.  When all the lines and labels cannot be shown in 
one screen the lines are brought closer to each other and 
the labels disappear.  In this silhouette, it is still possible 
to see the number of cases and their severity, the type of 
placements, and the number and date of the reviews.  
Once the overview has been appreciated, zooming can be 
used to expand a desired facet or a particular time period, 
or focus on a given case.<P>

<B>LIFELINES FOR MEDICAL RECORDS</B><P>
Because our Visual Basic prototype reads a simple input 
format it was easy to explore other data sets such as our 
own personal resumes and sample medical records, which 
lead to new designs and layouts [2].  For example a 
medical record overview might show alerts, consultations, 
letters, xrays, lab tests, etc. as icons, while medical 
conditions, and treatments would be shown as lines with 
color and size indicating severity or amounts. <P>

<B>ISSUES</B><P>
For designers, agreeing on an appropriate data encoding 
scheme is difficult.  Icons, colors and thickness codes 
have to be carefully chosen to avoid biases.  For 
developers, labeling needs to be optimized and smooth 
rescaling depends on efficient display algorithms.  A 
complete implementation of the LifeLines will need some 
data entry mechanism to append or correct existing 
records.  Our previous experience shows that constructing 
time lines by direct manipulation was an adequate 
solution in scheduling home automation devices [1].<P>

As a general visualization environment, LifeLines is not 
computationally demanding, requires only high level data 
descriptions, and can handle a variety of records.  These 
characteristics suggest that LifeLines could be used as a 
personal record format and rapidly exchanged or 
synchronized between multiple services.<P>

<B>CONCLUSION</B><P>
LifeLines can: 1) reduce the chances of missing 
information, 2) facilitate the spotting of anomalies and 
trends (intervals are easier to estimate on a timeline than 
in a table of dates), 3) streamline the access to details as 
LifeLines act as large menus, and 4) remain simple and 
tailorable to various applications. <P>
