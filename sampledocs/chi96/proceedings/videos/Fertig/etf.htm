<H2> ABSTRACT </H2>

We contend that managing one's own electronic world can be
a frustrating task for most computer users, 
requiring too many separate applications, too many file
transfers and format translations,
the invention of too many pointless names
and the construction of organizational hierarchies that too quickly become
obsolete.
What is needed is a metaphor and system for organizing
the electronic ``bits of paper'' we all so easily collect, whether we
create them ourselves or
they come to us in the form of email, downloaded images,
web pages, or scheduling reminders.
Lifestreams is such a system.  
<P>
<H2> Keywords </H2> Desktop metaphor, information retrieval, filtering, hierarchical
file systems, reminding, organization, information overload.

<H2> BASIC MODEL </H2>

Lifestreams uses a simple organizational
metaphor, a time-ordered stream of documents, to replace
conventional files and directories 
[<a href="#FreeFert95">3</a>,<a href="#WP">4</a>].  
<i> Stream filters </i> and software agents are used to organize, locate,
summarize and monitor incoming information.
Lifestreams subsumes many separate desktop applications
to accomplish the most common communication, scheduling, and search
and retrieval tasks; yet its machine-independent, client-server architecture is
<i> open </i> so that users can continue to use the document 
types, and viewers & editors they are accustomed to.<P>


A <i> lifestream </i> is a time-ordered stream of documents that functions as
a diary of your electronic life;
every document you create is stored in your lifestream, as are the
documents other people send you.  
The tail of your stream contains
documents from the past, perhaps starting with your electronic birth
certificate.  Moving away from the tail and toward the present, your stream 
contains more recent documents such as papers in progress or the latest electronic mail 
you've received---other documents, such as pictures,
correspondence, bills, movies, voice mail and software are stored
in between.  Moving beyond the present and into the future, the stream
contains documents you <i> will</i> need: reminders, your calendar items, and 
to-do lists. <P>



<H2> WHY LIFESTREAMS? </H2>

Studies [<a href="#lansdale">6</a>,<a href="#Malone83">7</a>,<a href="#Cole">1</a>,<a href="#pile">8</a>,<a href="#Cook">2</a>] have shown
that users of common desktop systems
have difficulty:

<UL>
<LI>  Organizing and finding information within hierarchical file systems.
<LI>  Making use of archived information, which users normally discard so that they are not overwhelmed by it.
<LI>  Getting a ``big picture" view.
<LI> Managing schedules and reminders.
</UL>

Lifestreams provides a metaphor for organizing
the electronic documents we all so easily collect---whether
they come to us in the form of electronic mail, downloaded images,
pages gathered from the Web, or scheduling reminders---in a fluid and natural 
way that reflects the way users work.<p>

<H2> THE LIFESTREAMS INTERFACE </H2>

The Lifestreams interface is presented in Figure 1,
showing a stream of documents.
The user can slide the mouse pointer over the
document representations to ``glance" at each
document,  or use the scroll bar in the lower left-hand corner to roll
themselves back into the past.<p>

<B> Figure 1: </B> The Lifestreams Interface.<p>
</center>


Color and animation indicate important document features.
The borders of unread documents are colored red, 
the borders of writable documents made thicker and open documents are
offset to the side to indicate they are being edited.  Incoming documents
slide in from the left side to alert the user, and 
newly created documents pop down from the top and push the
stream backwards by one document into the past.  In this way documents are
eventually moved out of view and archived automatically.<p>

Users interact with Lifestreams via five primary operations: <b>new</b>, 
<b>clone</b>, 
<b>transfer</b>, <b>find</b> and <b>summary</b>.   <b> New</b>
 and <b>clone</b> 
create documents.   <b>New</b> creates an empty document and
adds it to your stream.  <b>Clone</b> duplicates an existing document.
<b>Transfer</b> copies a document from your stream to someone else's.  
<b>Find</b> prompts the user for a search query and 
creates a <i> substream </i>.<p>

``Substreaming" provides an organizational framework and an inexpensive
way of finding information.
Substreams, like virtual directories [<a href="#MITSemantic">5</a>],
present the user with a ``view" of a document collection,  in our case,
all the documents that are relevant to a search 
query.  Substreams differ from
conventional directory systems in that, rather than placing documents into
fixed, file & folder directory structures, they create virtual organizations of 
documents from the stream.  
Documents are not actually stored in the substream;  the
substream is a temporary collection of documents that already exist
on the stream.  Two substreams may 
overlap.  Moreover, substreams can be created and destroyed on the fly
without affecting the organization provided by the stream or any existing
substream.  
Substreams are dynamic.  If you allow a substream to persist,
it will
collect new documents that match your search criteria as they are added to
your stream.
For example, a
substream created with the query ``find all documents created by
other people'' would subsume your mailbox and automatically collect
mail as it arrives.  A substream created from ``all electronic mail
I haven't responded to'' would act as a mailbox that only
contains unanswered mail.
Substreams can be
created incrementally, yielding a nested set of
menus.  
Semantically, this incremental
substreaming amounts to a boolean <tt> and </tt> of each new query with the
previous substream's query.<p>


Menus are used to choose among existing substreams, create
summaries and reset the ``time" system clock into the past or future.
The <b> summary </b> operation 
allows users to distill the information in a
large number of similar documents into a single overview by
taking a substream and compressing it into an overview document.
The content of the overview depends on the type of
documents in the substream.  For instance, if the substream contains
the daily closing prices of all the stocks and mutual funds in your
investment portfolio, the overview document may contain 
a chart displaying the historical performance of your securities along
with your net worth.  If the substream contains 
a list of tasks you need to complete, the overview document might
display a prioritized ``to-do" list.<p>

By default Lifestreams presents the user with a view of the stream from the
present receding into the past.  A lifestream also contains a future portion
which is accessible but usually hidden.
The interface contains a clock 
that displays the current time, which
may be temporarily reset to the future to observe the future part of 
the stream.
While in the future, users can deposit notes that act as 
reminders.  When the clock is reset
to the present these notes are once again hidden, however they
arrive on the stream at the appropriate time to remind the user.<p>

<H2> CONCLUSION </H2>

Computer users must deal with a far greater quantity and range of
electronic objects in their work and personal lives than ever before.
Desktop systems are inadequate for the task;
new systems must support the management of these objects efficiently
and transparently.  <p>

The success of Lotus Notes, and the transition in
operating systems toward a document-centric model (thus OLE and
OpenDoc) suggests that documents are now the sun around which
applications revolve.  Lifestreams takes this world a step further: It
embodies in software the stream of electronic events already facing
the user, and brings in applications (filters, summaries, agents, etc.)
as needed.  
Lifestreams replaces the desktop metaphor with
a more fluid and natural system that reflects the way users work.<p>
