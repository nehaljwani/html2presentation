<H3>ABSTRACT</H3>
<P>
Simple intuitive manipulation of three-dimensional objects is needed for
the conceptualizing phase of design. Present CAD systems do not allow for
the quick and interactive generation and development of objects, which are
based more on free-form ideas than on hard numerical input. This video presents
a prototype envisionment that uses intuitive 3D sketch input with two hands.

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>
The IDEATE research project [1] at our faculty concentrates on the conceptualizing
phase of the industrial design process; how designers generate ideas and
create form, and what kind of tools are used for these activities. The goal
is the development of an advanced electronic environment, made up of multi-nodal
tools, to support designers in the generation and development of new product
forms; tools for creative thinking, visualizing and conceptualizing. This
video reports on a concept for one of these tools: TIME, a 3-D sketching
device.
</P>

<H3>3-D CAD SYSTEMS</H3>
<P>Current 3-D CAD systems are heavily used at the end of the design process
when most of the geometry of a product is already determined. However, in
the conceptual phase, where initial ideas are being generated and explored,
designers still rely on the traditional design tools like pencil and paper.
These lack processing capabilities but instead score high from the point
of view of the designer as a performer, who puts high demands on his instruments,
concerning flexibility and agility, to perform his act, being the creation
of a new product form [2].
</P>

<H3>TWO HANDED INPUT</H3>
<P>
In a previous study [3] it was noted that designers use both hands for most
actions. While a fairly obvious notation, this analogy has yet to be fully
offered to the human computer user [4]. 
</P>
<P>
However, the first attempts are being made. Examples include the 3-DRAW
system from the M.I.T. CAD Lab [5], which uses two hands to create objects
in 3-dimensional space and our own Turntable/Grabber project [6], which
uses a special input device for rotating/tilting a computerized object with
one hand, and another specialized device for selecting/altering points on
the object.
</P>

<H3>TIME</H3>
<P>
The goal of this project was therefore the development of a concept for
a 3-D sketching device, which would a) allow simple and intuitive generation,
manipulation and evaluation of three-dimensional objects in the conceptual
phase, and b) make use of both hands for input. The concept was named TIME:
Three-dimensional Input, Manipulation and Evaluation.
</P>
<P>
To derive the requirements for TIME 13 interviews with professional industrial
designers were conducted, in which they were asked for their design habits,
drawing techniques and their preferences and ideas for an ideal sketching
tool [7].
</P>
<P>
Based on the results of the interviews 6 different interaction-concepts
for TIME were generated. These concepts were then laid before a panel of
11 respondents. From their comments a program of requirements was listed,
upon which the final concept of TIME was based [7].
</P>

<H3>HARDWARE</H3>
<P>
TIME consists of three pieces of hardware: the pen, the watch and the tablet
(figure 1). The pen is used for sketching and manipulating on both the watch
and the tablet. Switching between these two modes is accomplished by pressing
a button on the graphical user interface. The watch is used for positioning
the sketch plane, evaluating the model and placement of the lights. It is
to be held in the non-dominant hand and has three buttons.
</P>
<P>
The tablet is the main input for sketch data and displays the graphical
user interface. Extra functionality on the tablet includes manipulation
of the camera settings. Trackpads are used to perform panning rotation and
zooming.
</P>

<H3>GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACES</H3>
<P>
There are two graphical user interfaces, one on the watch and one on the
tablet. The interface on the watch is kept to a minimum because of the limited
screen area. It is used to set the mode of the watch to that of object mode,
camera mode or light mode. The other graphical user interface is located
on the tablet. Its main functionality's include the interface to the file
system, the libraries of pre-defined contours, profiles or shapes and the
selection of different editing tools.
</P>
<H3>SOFTWARE</H3>
<P>
The software assists in three major tasks: input, modification and evaluation.
All of the sub-tasks have been divided over the input devices, taking into
account the properties of the hands mentioned before.
</P>
<P>
For input, several strategies are available. The combination of input devices
is well suited to the extrusion of two-dimensional contours, the dominant
hand is used for drawing the contour to be sweeped while the non-dominant
hand defines the path the contour travels.
</P>
<P>Three types of object modification tasks are offered with two-handed support;
common edit tasks (e.g. copy/paste), local deformations (vertex, curve editing)
and global deformations (scaling, bending etc.).
</P>
<P>Evaluation of the model under construction can either be object-oriented
or scene-oriented. An example of the first technique is the possibility
to evaluate cross-sections of the model by moving the watch inside the object,
the cross-section will then be displayed on the watch. The second evaluation
technique is used when the camera's position or orientation is manipulated
by one of the track pads on the tablet.
</P>
<H3>INTEGRATION OF THE PARTS</H3>
<P>
Scripts are used to the define the interaction between the software, the
input devices and the user interfaces. For each essential modeling operation,
several possible strategies are considered and defined. In addition to the
static scripts a video was made to show this interaction in full motion.
