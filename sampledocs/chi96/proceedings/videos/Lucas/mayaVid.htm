<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>
<P>
The Visage prototype responds to data-intensive work 
environments where users, exploring and analyzing data, 
struggle to make useful multiple applications with 
disparate visualizations of potentially related 
information. Visage seeks to coordinate the exploration, 
analyses, and visualizations of information regardless of 
their source or type. This coordination is accomplished 
by using an information-centric approach to user 
interface design to eliminate impediments to direct user 
access to information objects across applications and 
visualizations. Visage consists of a set of data 
manipulation operations, an intelligent system for 
generating data visualizations and a briefing tool that 
supports the conversion of visual displays used into 
interactive presentation slides.

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>
Visage is an evolving user interface and software 
environment [1] with the goal of creating four important 
component capabilities:
<ol>
<li>A unique data navigation method using drill-down and 
roll-up techniques for navigating multi-dimensional data.
<li>An information-centric drag-and-drop user interface 
paradigm by which users interact with data and 
applications.
<li>Intelligent tools for dynamic generation of 
visualizations. 
<li>A fully integrated presentation and briefing 
environment.
</ol>
<P>
The information-centric approach of Visage allows the 
operations applied to information be applied directly to 
the physical objects representing this information and 
not by the mechanics of running other applications to do 
so.  In Visage, no data query needs to be constructed in 
advance in an abstract language; users can "get their 
hands on the data", and perform whatever operations they 
would like.
<p>
A VISAGE SCENARIO
<P>
In order to convey the basic elements of Visage, it is 
useful to consider some simple displays and operations 
in a detailed example. The example is based on an 
application of Visage that we are developing to support 
the  next generation of logistics' tracking and planning 
systems. These systems are being developed by the 
government to enable analysts to access information 
about the location, quantities, status, transportation, 
distribution, consumption and other properties of 
equipment and supplies and the people who need them 
worldwide.
<p>
One of many displays that can be produced in the 
Visage environment is an outliner-style table (Figure 1).  
It is one way to provide a hierarchical perspective on 
tabular data and efficiently displays tabular information.

<h3>Data-navigation: Drill-down, Roll-up</h3>
<p>
Starting from any point in a data network users may 
access a menu of alternative dimensions along which 
they may navigate.  The user can choose to drill down 
along one of these dimensions by selecting any of the 
relations from the menu.  The result is a more detailed 
organizational breakdown.  This drill-down process can 
occur across different  relations.  For example, it is 
possible for a user to drill-down from a division to the 
equipment it possesses and then from one type of 
equipment to the parts or supplies it requires and then to 
all the supply points that have those parts available.  
This is a process of turning a network or web of relations 
into multiple hierarchies for navigational purposes.  
Users can select any attribute of the objects in the 
hierarchy that they want to have displayed, like the 
weight of supplies a unit requires, its echelon, the 
number of people in the unit, etc.  As the hierarchy is 
expanded, the data attributes are expanded with it.  The 
dynamic drill-down and expression of attribute values is 
a fundamental operation in Visage that can occur in 
every display.  That is, drill down can occur as easily in 
a bar-chart or on a map as on the outliner.
<p>
The complement to the data navigation technique of 
drill-down is roll-up (aggregation).  Subsets of units can 
be rolled-up (i.e. aggregated) into a single object and 
named by the user, in this case, "North hi supply units." 
It appears in the bottom of the outliner and its attributes 
are the appropriate totals of those for the units it 
aggregates.  The new aggregate can be treated as a 
single object, which may be drilled down to show other 
units, their support, inventory or other information.  This 
approach enables users to compose a complex query 
through a series of drill-down, drag, paint and roll-up 
operations.  In Visage very complex queries may be 
composed entirely by direct manipulation.
<p>
<h3>Information-Centric Data Manipulation: Drag-
and-Drop</h3>
<p>
An important operation in this information-centric 
interface approach [2] is the direct-manipulation 
movement of information throughout the Visage 
environment.  Objects representing information are 
moved directly in groups or individually among 
visualization and application interfaces via simple drag-
and-drop operations.  In order to display some of the 
attributes of these units graphically, one simply drags 
the unit names from the outliner to an empty bar chart 
display. In this case, a bar chart shows the weight of 
supplies that the units require.  Displaying unit supply 
weights in a bar chart makes it easy to select units 
requiring the most supplies - those with the longest bars. 
Focusing on the units with highest supply weights 
provides an opportunity to display the locations of just 
these units on a map, perhaps to determine the locations 
where supply points should be established.  Units are 
transferred to a mapping application using the same drag 
and drop operation.
<p>
The map application used in Visage is a product called 
MATT which was developed prior to and independently 
of Visage by Bolt, Beranek and Newman.  This is an 
example of one of the primary goals of this work, which 
is to provide the mortar necessary to cement together 
separately developed analysis tools into what the user 
will experience as an integrated work environment.  By 
default, the map arranges objects by latitude and 
longitude, and uses standard military symbology to 
represent the units.
<p>
Another technique used in the Visage user interface 
environment to improve exploration and analysis of data 
is color highlighting or painting.  By color highlighting a 
subset of units on the map, (perhaps to identify a region 
where large quantities of supplies will be needed) 
multiple displays may be visually coordinated [3].  
Painting an object in one display causes it to be 
similarly colored in all other displays.  Together, the 
three displays show the selected units, how many 
supplies they need, and where they are located.
<p>
<h3>Intelligent Visualizations with Sage </h3>
<p>
Visage incorporates the capabilities of Sage, a 
knowledge-based presentation system that designs 
graphical displays of complex data (e.g. quantitative, 
relational, temporal, hierarchical. categorical, 
geographic) [4] to provide automatic graphics 
generation. We have demonstrated the use of Sage to 
automatically assume the burden of visualizing 
information for other applications and for computer-
supported graphic design, especially for large data sets. 
Complete integration between Visage and Sage is the 
goal of our work during the next year.
<p>
<h3>Integrated and Interactive Presentations</h3>
<p>
The Visage environment has a simple briefing or "slide 
show" feature completely integrated into the application. 
As analyses are performed, text and graphics can be 
captured and saved in special frames called "slides."  A 
slide is simple a frame designed to make it easy to 
"paste up" other frames and elements for visual 
presentations. The user simply "drags and drops" the 
desired displays onto the slide frame, where they are 
scaled appropriately.  Note that elements on the slide do 
not lose their separate identity--they are still fully-
functional interface objects that can be used for further 
analysis--even in the midst of a briefing.  Collections of 
slides are accumulated in a "slide sorter" frame, used to 
sequence a presentation via simple drag operations, and 
to display each slide sequentially at full-screen size. 
Thus, the briefing function has been seamlessly 
integrated with those of data exploration and analysis.
