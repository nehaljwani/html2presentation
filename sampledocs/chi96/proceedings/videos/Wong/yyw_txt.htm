<B>Abstract </B><BR>
This paper proposes &quottemporal typography&quot as an area of study which 
incorporates the dynamic visual treatment of text as an extension of written language. 
Design examples presented in the video show the expressive power of time-varying 
typographic form to convey emotion and tones of voice. Several expressive examples are 
called out in this paper and discussed. As a part of our ongoing research, we have 
developed a scheme which allows for the description of typographic expressions that 
change dynamically over time. The examples were constructed using a software tool, 
exPress, along with a scripting language based on the scheme. <P>

<B>Introduction</B><BR>
When we talk to one another, the affective aspect and tone of our voice adds an expressive 
quality to the words spoken. We may choose to emphasize a point by raising the pitch of 
our voice or stretch out the enunciation of a word. It is even possible to negate the meaning 
of a phrase with the tone of the delivery. For example, depending on how the phrase "I 
said I am sorry" is spoken, sincerity or sarcasm can be conveyed. <P>

Typography is the visual treatment of written language to enrich visual communication [3]. 
Similar to the expressivity of spoken words, a range of emotional qualities and tones of 
voice can be conveyed through treatment of the typographic form, such as typeface, weight 
and color. Examples of this can be seen in cartoons as well as publication design. 
However, the treatment has been limited to a fixed presentation medium such as a printed 
page. Once a specific form is applied, it remains fixed. The fixed presentation cannot 
capture affective aspects conveyed through temporal delivery, for example, a vocal 
inflection or a change in meter of the spoken word. Whereas the printed medium constrains 
typographic investigation to fixed presentation, electronic media extends the expressive 
possibilities by enabling typographic forms to change dynamically in size, color and 
position according to a writer's expression or a reader's interaction in real time. <P>

Current electronic communication systems such as electronic mail remain typographically 
constrained. In general, only one kind of typeface at a fixed size is supported. This 
constraint limits the expressive capabilities of typographic communication. Users get 
around this constraint by developing various methods to convey expression, such as 
extending the spelling of a word or inventing symbols. Studies have shown the 
development of symbols, such as &quotsmileys&quot, at the end of text messages are used 
to qualify the tone of voice of content (i.e., friendly, sarcastic, hostile). Our research 
proposes an alternative approach, one that extends the tradition of typography by treating 
text dynamically as it is presented over time. For example, the sequence in Figure 1 shows 
the word &quotthing&quot stretched and distorted based on a spring simulation. The 
physically-based motion qualifies the word with a humorous twang. By manipulating the 
text itself it is hoped a larger range of expressivity can be achieved. <P>

TV advertising graphics have been exploring the use of dynamic text to enrich visual 
communication. Typical application of this form of communication has been limited 
because it involved a case by case design intensive process. The research here differs from 
TV applications with two respects. First, the broad introduction of electronic media has 
enabled us to consider typography in non-static terms in our day-to-day settings. We have 
developed a scheme which provides users with a set of concepts and terminology for 
describing the behavior of dynamic forms [6]. A descriptive scheme allows dynamic forms 
to be described systematically and represented in computational form. Forms are described 
for a general purpose, rather than for a particular piece of text. In other words, these forms 
can be labeled, stored and reused. Second, the research takes into consideration the two 
way interaction between a writer and a reader. We want to support a writer's expressive 
temporal message as well as a reader's control over the pacing through the message. An 
example is the &quotsorry&quot message in the video.<P>

<B>Implementation</B> <BR>
To facilitate our investigation on temporal typography, a software tool, exPress, has been 
implemented along with a scripting language based on the scheme. The tool allows us to 
easily manipulate typographic attributes such as size, weight, position, transparency, and 
color. Users can interactively control the speed as well as their pace through the 
presentations. Physically-based motion techniques, such as spring simulation [4] are 
implemented as part of this tool. The software is implemented using C++ on a Silicon 
Graphics' Onyx with Reality Engine graphics. The design examples shown in the video 
were constructed using this tool. <P>

<B>Design experiments</B> <BR>
The video shows preliminary design examples that explore dynamic presentation of text, 
including expressive email, visualization of dialogue, and typographic tone of voice. These 
examples are part of our ongoing research effort that investigates the potential for 
expressive writing as well as for developing new methods of reading. <P>

We are exploring a range of ways dynamic text can convey typographic expression by 
making concrete design examples. The discussion here is limited to three such 
examples.<P>

1. Dynamic form can embellish the meaning of a word and give the reading of the word an 
inflection. For example, the sentence &quotCan you do me a favor&quot is presented 
serially one word after another. When favor is presented, the form grows in size quickly 
until it covers the screen. You read &quotfavor&quot yet &quotbig&quot is implied by the 
changing form. Because the form grows over time, the tone starts out tentative and then 
rises.<P>

2. The rhythm of a presentation can effect the tone of voice conveyed. The second message 
on the video expresses two tones of voice through contrasting rhythms. While the first part 
of the message expresses a sluggish apologetic tone, the following part expresses a 
confident recovery. The overall speed of movement in the first part of the presentation is 
slow. For examples, the words &quotglug! glug! glug&quot are dropped in sequence from 
the top of the screen. As each word falls on the ground plane, they bounce slowly and 
seem to lose energy (Figure 2). The overall tone is sluggish and apologetic. In contrast, the 
movements are concise and quick in the second part of the message. The words &quotwe 
are back on track&quot are presented quickly in succession and fly out toward the screen 
seemingly past the reader (Figure 3). The faster speed of the rhythm communicates a 
confident disposition.<P>

the user expresses a confident tone.</font><P>

3. Motion which references physical action can elaborate an expression. The previous 
example references a technique conventionalized in film to depict the perceptual feel of 
riding on a train track. In another example, the word &quotoverwhelmed&quot is flipped 
as it is presented. The action references the metaphor of being &quotupside-down&quot or 
&quoton your back&quot.  These references qualify just how overwhelmed the writer felt. 
<P>

As for reading methods, we are exploring the use of previously established dynamic 
presentation methods such as Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) in which one or 
more words are presented in the same location serially [2]. Experimental results on RSVP 
have shown it to be a promising method of reading. Time Square [1], or scrolling, is 
another method used widely in computer interfaces to move through text. A new 
presentation method we are exploring places text one after another in the z-dimension as 
shown in Figure 4. We refer to this method as Landscape. Three dimensional perspective is 
used and the reader controls the viewpoint. The default viewing position is slightly above 
the plane of text. For reading, a user presses a mouse button to fly past the message-as if 
flying over a highway of text. Movement is confined to one degree, forward and 
backward. The user controls the speed in which she moves over the text. Since a user can 
move and stop as she chooses, she is able to determine her own pace through the 
message.<P>

<B>Conclusion and future work</B> <BR>
This paper presents our approach to enriching the expressivity of written communication on 
electronic media. We described specific design experiments on conveying tone of voice 
through dynamic treatment of text as well as presentation methods we are exploring. Future 
work includes refining our scheme as well as developing an understanding of typographic 
tone conveyed through dynamic presentation. We have begun to explore a WYSIWIG 
interface to the tool for constructing dynamic typographic forms.<P>
