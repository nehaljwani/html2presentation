<P>
The TileBars interface is a graphical tool for users of information
access systems, that shows the relationship between
the terms in a query and the documents that are retrieved in response
to that query.  TileBars simultaneously and compactly indicate
relative document length and query term overlap, frequency and
distribution.  The patterns in a column of TileBars are meant to help
users  make fast judgments about the potential relevance of the
retrieved documents.  An unexpected benefit of the interface is that
because it requires users to specify their queries as a list of
topics, better rank orderings can be obtained than with standard
information retrieval ranking mechanisms.

<P>
Information Access research at Xerox PARC focuses on amplifying the
users' cognitive abilities, rather than trying to completely automate
them.  This framework emphasizes the participation of the user in a
cycle of query formulation, presentation of retrieval results,
and query reformulation.  The information
presented is typically not document descriptions, but rather
intermediate information that indicates relationships between the
query and the retrieved documents.  We have developed information
access tools intended to supply some of this functionality.  This
video demonstrates one of these, called <em> TileBars</em>
[<A HREF="mah_txt.htm#hearst95b">3</A>].
<P>
In a typical information retrieval system, documents satifying the
query are returned and are rank-ordered according to some function of
the number of hits for each term [<A HREF="mah_txt.htm#salton88">5</A>].  We argue that this
kind of ranking is opaque to the user, in part because it is not clear
how well each term is represented in the retrieved documents.
<P>
By contrast, the TileBars graphical interface allows the user to make
informed decisions about which documents and which passages of those
documents to view, based on the distributional behavior of the query
terms in the documents.  The goal is to simultaneously and compactly
indicate (i) the relative length of the document, (ii) the frequency
of the term sets in the document, and (iii) the distribution of the
term sets with respect to the document and to each other.
<P>
The TileBar interface requires the user to type queries into a list of
entry windows.  Each entry line is called a <i> termset</i> since it is
intended to contain a set of terms representing one topic.  Typically,
the query is treated as a conjunction of topics, and the topics are
listed in order of importance.
<P>
In order to perform retrieval over full text (as opposed to just
titles and abstracts), we impose some very simple structure on the
documents in the collection.  Each document is partitioned in advance
into segments, the size and extent of which can be determined several
different ways.  The orthographic structure provided by the author, in
terms of paragraphs, pages, or sections, can be used if available.  A
still simpler alternative is to use contiguous blocks of text of a
fixed size.  These two approaches have drawbacks: author- provided
structure can vary greatly in length and meaning, and fixed-length
blocks are not intuitive units to show to users.  We prefer to 
use a robust, statistical segmentation algorithm called <i>
TextTiling</i> [<A HREF="mah_txt.htm#hearst94a">2</A>] to subdivide documents into
multi-paragraph subtopical units.  This algorithm allows for the
creation of meaningful, or motivated, segments even if the author has
provided none, and allows for customization of the average segment
length.
<P>
Figure <A HREF="mah_txt.htm#tilebarfig">1</A> shows an example of the TileBars display on a
query about automated systems for medical diagnosis. The graphical
representation works as follows.  Each rectangle represents a
document.  Each row of the rectangle represents the corresponding
termset in the query display, i.e, the top row corresponds to <i>
patient, medicine,</i> or <i> medical</i>, the second row to <i> test,
scan, cure,</i> or <i> diagnosis</i>, and the third row to <i> software</i>
or <i> program</i>.  The rectangles are also subdivided into columns,
where each column represents a text segment, as described above.
Thus, the leftmost column indicates the first segment, or paragraph,
of the document, the column to the right of this indicates the second
segment of the document, and so on.
<P>
Each square represents the number of hits for the corresponding
termset in the corresponding document segment.  The darkness of the
square indicates the number of times the query occurs in that
segment of text; the darker the square the greater the number of hits
(white indicates 0, black indicates 8 or more hits, the frequencies of
all the terms within a term set are added together).
<P>
Thus the user can quickly see if some subset of the terms overlap in
the same segment of the document, and can see at what position of the
document this overlap occurs.  For example, the bottommost TileBar in
Figure <A HREF="mah_txt.htm#tilebarfig">1</A> shows that all three termsets overlap only in
the very last subtopical segment; from this the user can assume that
there is only a passing reference to medical applications at the
end of the document.  As another example, in the fourth TileBar,
the title implies that the article discusses computer
automation of medical admissions (to a veteran's hospital), as opposed
to automation of diagnosis.  However, the TileBar reveals that terms
from the diagnosis termset are indeed well represented in the document.

TileBars allow users to indicate which part of the document to view.
by mouse-clicking on the corresponding part of the representation.
that symbolizes the beginning of the document.  For example, a user
may go directly to a segment in the middle of the text where termsets
overlap, knowing in advance how far down in the document the passage
occurs.  In a newer version of the interface [<A HREF="mah_txt.htm#hearst96b">1</A>], each
termset is color-coded and the terms of the termset are highlighted
with the corresponding color when the text of the document is
displayed.
<P>
The version of the interface demonstrated in the videotape allows the
user to adjust constraints: minimum number of hits for each term set,
minimum distribution (the percentage of tiles containing at least one
hit), and minimum adjacent overlap span.  In Figure
<A HREF="mah_txt.htm#tilebarfig">1</A> the user has indicated that the diagnosis aspect of
the query must be strongly present in the retrieved documents, by
setting the minimum term distribution percentage to 30% for the
second termset.
<P>
A system that simply ranks the documents does not make these kinds of
distinctions available to the user.  The TileBar ranking order is
different than that of standard systems.  In the implementation
demonstrated here, documents are ranked first by how many segments
have overlap of all three termsets, second by the overall frequency of
the query terms in the document.  We have recently 
[<A HREF="mah_txt.htm#hearst96a">4</A>] obtained strong improvements in precision at high
document cutoff levels  by requiring the query to be
specified in terms of a list of topics, and then applying two
constraints that take advantage of the query structure.  Our initial
user studies [<A HREF="mah_txt.htm#hearst96b">1</A>] suggest that users seem to find the
query format easy to use.
