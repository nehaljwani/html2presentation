<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<EM>We demonstrate a focus+context (fisheye) scheme for visualizing and
manipulating large hierarchies.  Our approach is to lay out the hierarchy
uniformly on the hyperbolic plane and map this plane onto a circular display
region.  The projection onto the disk provides a natural mechanism for
assigning more space to a portion of the hierarchy while still embedding it in
a much larger context.  Change of focus is accomplished by translating the
structure on the hyperbolic plane, which allows a smooth transition without
compromising the presentation of the context.

<P>
The amount of information that can coherently be displayed on the screen of an
interactive computer system can dramatically affect the ease of interacting
with a large information structure.  We demonstrate the Hyperbolic Browser
technique for displaying and manipulating large hierarchies and graphs which
have been converted to trees (e.g. by a bread-first walk and insertion of
``revisited'' nodes) [<A HREF="hb-video.html#hbjvlc">1</A>,<A HREF="hb-video.html#hbchi">2</A>].  For example, it is well suited for
browsing organization charts, file system hierarchies, and the link structure
of WWW servers and spaces.  We have implemented versions of the hyperbolic
browser in Common Lisp, C++, and Java and applied it to Web Space visualization
as a client executable, a server-based cgi image-map-generating extension, and
a Java applet.
<P>
The hyperbolic browser (Figure <A HREF="hb-video.html#radial">1</A>) provides a smoothly-varying focus+context
or fisheye view.  The display space allocated to a node falls off continuously
with distance from the focus.  The context always includes several generations
of parents, siblings, and children, making it easy for the user to explore the
hierarchy without getting lost.  The tree is initially displayed with its root
at the center, but the display can be smoothly transformed to bring other nodes
into focus (see Figure <A HREF="hb-video.html#animation1">2</A>).  We have developed effective procedures for
manipulating the focus using selection as well as pointer dragging, and for
smoothly animating transitions across such manipulation.
<P>
This technique compares favorably with conventional hierarchy displays and
other novel techniques [<A HREF="hb-video.html#hbjvlc">1</A>].  In a 600 pixel by 600 pixel window, a
conventional 2-d browser can typically display 100 nodes (w/ 3 character text
strings).  The hyperbolic browser can display 1000 nodes of which about the 50
nearest the focus can show from 3 to dozens of characters of text.  Thus the
hyperbolic browser can display up to 10 times as many nodes and provide more
effective navigation around the hierarchy.

<P>
We lay out the hierarchy on the hyperbolic plane, and then map this
mathematical construct onto a circular display region.  The hyperbolic plane is
a non-Euclidian geometry where parallel lines diverge from one another.  Thus,
the circumference of a circle grows exponentially with its radius, which means
that exponentially more space is available with increasing distance.  Thus
hierarchies---which tend to expand exponentially with depth---can be laid out
uniformly in hyperbolic space, so the distance between parents, children, and
siblings is roughly the same across the hierarchy.
<P>
We use a recursive algorithm that lays out each node based on local
information.  A node is allocated a wedge of the hyperbolic plane, angling out
from itself, to put its descendants in.  It places all its children along an
arc in that wedge, at an equal distance from itself, and far enough out so that
the children are some minimum distance apart from each other.  Each of the
children then gets a sub-wedge for its descendants.  Because of the divergence
of parallel lines, each child typically gets a wedge spanning about as big an
angle as does its parent's.
<P>
The hyperbolic plane can be mapped onto the Euclidean unit disk, which provides
a means for displaying it on a display.  The two canonical ways of mapping the
hyperbolic plane to the unit disk, the Klein model (projective) and the
Poincar&#233; model (conformal), map a vicinity in the hyperbolic plane to a focus
at the center of the disk while the rest of the hyperbolic plane fades off
perspective-like toward the edge of the disk.  The Poincar&#233; model (used in
the figures) works better for visualizing hierarchies, because it preserves the
fan-out shapes at nodes and uses the screen real-estate more efficiently.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION00030000000000000000> CHANGING FOCUS</A></H1>
<P>
A change of focus is implemented as a geometric translation of the structure on
the hyperbolic plane.  The user can change focus either by clicking on any
visible point to bring it into focus at the center, or by dragging any visible
point to any other position (with immediate feedback).  In either case, the
rest of the display transforms appropriately.  Regions that approach the center
become magnified, while regions that were in the center shrink as they move
toward the edge.  Thus the user can browse the tree structure while maintaining
the visual context.  User understanding of a jump to a new focus is greatly
improved if the transition is animated.  This is done by calculating an
``nth-root'' transformation, which applied n times will have the same effect as
the original, and using this transformation successively to generate
intermediate frames, as illustrated with an n of 3 in
Figure <A HREF="hb-video.html#animation1">2</A>.
<P>
Doing successive translations in the hyperbolic plane will, in general, cause
rotations, which are disorienting.  To avoid this, a rotation component is
added to translations so that the node in focus on the display will have a
canonical orientation.  The canonical orientation that we have found most
effective is to have the parent of the focus node be in a canonical direction.
<P>
Responsive display performance is crucial for supporting interactive dragging
and for supporting animated transitions on jump changes.  This can be a problem
for large hierarchies.  We achieve rapid redisplay by compromising on display
quality during animation and interactive dragging.  Fortunately, the rendering
compromises don't affect the coherence of the motion and are often unnoticed at
animation speeds.  Two effective compromises are to draw less of the fringe and
to draw lines, rather than arcs.  Other compromises including dropping text
during animation, may destroy coherence of motion.
<P>
<H1><A NAME=SECTION00040000000000000000> CONCLUSION</A></H1>
<P>
Hyperbolic geometry provides an elegant solution to the problem of providing a
focus+context display for large hierarchies.  The hyperbolic plane has the room
to lay out large hierarchies uniformly, and the Poincar&#233; map provides a
natural, continuously graded, focus+context mapping from the hyperbolic plane
to a display.  The hyperbolic browser supports interaction with larger
hierarchies than conventional browsers with modest computational requirements.
