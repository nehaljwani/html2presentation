<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>

<P>
A software and hardware system related to the design of a force
feedback assistance service (FAS) for human-computer interfaces
is described. FAS is a service which can be applied to human-computer
interfaces utilizing a force feedback pointing device. The force
feedback device guides the user's hand in order to facilitate
direct manipulation tasks either for training or for improving
performance and comfort. Artificial neural networks are used to
adapt, in real-time, to the user's task. In order to facilitate
the design and understanding of the FAS, a Wizard of Oz technique
was designed.
<H2>KEYWORDS</H2>

interface design, artificial neural networks.
<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

<P>
Current research is investigating the feasibility of a new kind
of user interface designed to act as an assistant, rather than
as a rigid tool, in order to find ways to make human machine processes
more productive. The goal of adaptive systems is to increase system
suitability for specific tasks; facilitate handling the system
for specific users, thus enhancing user productivity; and optimize
workload and increase user satisfaction. Traditional adaptivity
in the form of an adaptive system is based on the assumption that
a system is able to adapt itself to the wishes and tasks of the
user through an evaluation of user behaviour.
<P>
Force feedback technology offers a new performance support system
paradigm: since a force feedback device is used as the pointing
device, it allows a system to physically guide the user's hand.
This video presents underlying principles and systems investigated
for designing such a service: the Pantograph device, a Wizard
of Oz technique and an artificial neural network.
<H2>APPROACH</H2>

<P>
The Pantograph is a force feedback device intended for direct
manipulation. Its mechanical structure is based on a five bar
linkage that guarantees stability, little friction and provides
a comfortable 10x16 cm workspace with a 10 newton peak-force [3].
<P>
The Pantograph is mainly used for providing visually impaired
users with access to GUIs [4], i.e. for pointing, selecting and
resizing graphical objects while returning a haptic translation
of the graphics to the user.
<P>
Since Pantograph offers force feedback, it can also be used to
guide the hand of the user: for instance, quickly pointing to
small icons, selecting the thin window frames, opening pop-up
menus and selecting items. It is assumed that during learning
stages, users will benefit from such physical help: the learning
stage would be quicker and comfort would be improved.
<H2>THE WIZARD OF OZ TECHNIQUE</H2>

<P>
In order to design the physical guide, a Wizard of Oz technique
(WOz) was investigated. WOz is an experimental evaluation mechanism
which allows observation of a user operating an apparently fully
functioning system whose missing services are supplemented by
a hidden wizard. In the absence of generalizable theories and
models, the WOz technique is an appropriate approach to the identification
of design solutions [2,6].
<P>
Our WOz system is composed of two workstations linked via a local
network (using Network Dynamic Data Exchange under Microsoft Windows).
A user (visually impaired or sighted) is put into a work situation
and uses Pantograph as a pointing device. An observer (the Wizard)
monitors the user via a second machine which reproduces all or
part of the first machine's reciprocal objects and actions. Thus,
the Wizard is able to analyze and estimate, in real time, how
and when it should take control of the Pantograph and guide or
suggest actions to the user. For instance, in a training stage,
the Wizard may notice that the user has difficulties with pointing
tasks. The Wizard will then realize these tasks using the mouse.
Meanwhile, Pantograph will move according to mouse motions, giving
the user physical guidelines.
<H2>ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN)</H2>

<P>
The user interface is the part of a system responsible for getting
input from the user and for presenting system output to the user.
A system that adapts either of these functions to the user's task
or user characteristics or user preferences is an adaptive interface
[1]. Current research proposes the use of ANNs as the kernel of
a user model for adapting the haptic channel. ANNs have been developed
to simulate human problem solving resources and mechanisms and
have shown stronger abilities in learning and flexible knowledge
processing (e.g., generalizing knowledge to novel situations)
than conventional AI techniques, such as symbolic processing [2].
<H3>How the ANN works</H3>

<P>
The ANN designed for the FAS presents itself to the user as a
box of knowledge. The box receives a coordinate (Xn,Yn) representing
Pantograph's position, supplies a coordinate (Xn+1,Yn+1) and then
auto-organizes according to these last coordinates.
<P>
In this way, the ANN realizes two functions:
<P>
1. location of a coordinate: this consists of offering the user
a means of using the interface in a quasi-natural manner, thereby
allowing the user to better effect a task.
<P>
2. learning: this consists of restructuring information concerning
the force parameters returned to the user.
<P>
A single layer of neurons is used. It grids-off the interface,
with a neuron located in each space, according to graphic complexity.
The layer contains all the possible positions within the interface.
According to the granularity of the grid, a neuron could represent
a coordinate on the user's path.
<P>
The underlying principle is to reward the neurons which compose
the last path the user followed when accomplishing a task, and
punish those not along the path. This has the effect of increasing
the links between the selected neurons while decreasing the links
with the neurons of their neighbours. In this way, the force parameters
associated with the path are augmented, literally using force-feedback
to pull the user from point A to point B in the interface.
<H3>Mathematical Model of the Metaphor</H3>

<P>
We define:
<P>
Px,y representing the vector of the coordinates making up the
path used by Pantograph.
<P>
Mx,y the matrix corresponding to the screen's neuron grid
<P>
Nij(Px,y) represents the vector of the value nij (nul except for
value nij)
<H3>The ANN Activation Algorithm</H3>

<P>
<B>1. <I>Initialization</I>.</B> Select random values to initialize
the weight vectors of each neuron wij(0). The only restriction
is that weight be randomly negative or positive.
<P>
<B>2. <I>Activity vector</I>.</B> Create vector position Px,y=
[(x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), (x4,y4), (x5,y5), (x6,y6), ..... (xn,yn),
representing Pantograph's activity during a period of time S.
<P>
<B>3. <I>Similarity framework</I>.</B> Activation of neuron nij
is propagated using element h of Nij(Px,y) = Mx,y = nij using
the following formula:
<P>
xij(t)= k * Nij(Px,y) * W(t)
<P>
where xij(t-1) OE]0,1].
<P>
<B>4. <I>Next coordinate Px,y.</I></B> To determine the next coordinate
Px,y: Px,ynew = MAX Nij(Px,y)
<H3>Learning Algorithm</H3>

<P>
For each element of vector Px,y
<P>
Determine nij : the element h of Nij(Px,y) = Mx,y = nij
<P>
Determine nkh : the element h+1 of Nij(Px,y)=Mx,y = nij
<P>
Apply the following function to the links of matrix W:
<P>
For all wij linking neuron nij to neuron nkh
<P>
wij(t) = wij(t-1) + b(1 - wij(t-1)) where 0&#163;b&#163;1.
<P>
For all wij linking nij to all other neurons
<P>
wij(t) = - wij(t-1) - b(1 - wij(t-1)) where 0&#163;b&#163;1.
<H2>CONCLUSION</H2>

<P>
The introduction of an adaptive mechanism reduces iteration at
a number of levels: 1) the interface is designed and programmed
to be modifiable during interaction time, and 2) all or part of
the modifications are left to the system, including 3) evaluation
of the adaptive mechanism. As for the FAS, the ANN evaluates and
defines manipulation parameters-force, speed and direction-without
modifying the graphic interface. The FAS considers the ergonomic
reality of the interface, without directly changing it, and offers
the user the means to bypass design errors as if they were physical
obstacles. At the same time, it becomes an indicator of design
problems.
