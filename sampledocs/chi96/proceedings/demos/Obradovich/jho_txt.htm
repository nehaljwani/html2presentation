<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>

We have conducted a series of studies aimed at understanding how to design a tutoring system that will 
support students in expanding their knowledge of immunohematology and in developing their problem-
solving skills in a problem-based learning environment [3].  Results from these studies have led to the 
development of an expert model of problem solving, the identification of common errors and 
misconceptions in solving such problems, and the development of a model of expert tutoring in this 
domain.<P>
<P>

Based on the results of these studies, we designed the Transfusion Medicine Tutor and evaluated its 
effectiveness in teaching medical technology students to solve antibody identification cases.  In our initial 
evaluation of TMT, the students who used a version of the system with all tutoring functions turned on 
and with instructor assistance went from 0% correct on  a pre-test case to 87%-93% correct on post-test 
cases.  This compares with an improvement rate of 20% by students who used a passive version of the 
system with the intelligent tutoring functions turned off.  The behavioral protocols collected as part of 
this study provide further evidence regarding the contribution of the task environment, the interface 
design, and the use of expert systems technology to detect and remediate errors (in cooperation with a 
human teacher) to the student's learning.<P>

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

We have conducted a series of studies aimed at understanding how to aid students in learning successful 
strategies to solve complex problems[1, 2].  Based on the insights gained from these studies, we have 
designed and built the Transfusion Medicine Tutor (TMT) as a testbed for studying design concepts for 
the development of a general model for teaching abduction.  TMT is an expert-systems-based tutoring 
system for teaching medical technology students the abduction task of red cell antibody 
identification.<P>

<H2>ANTIBODY IDENTIFICATION</H2>

Red cell antibody identification is a laboratory workup task, where medical technologists must run a 
series of tests and analyze a large amount of data to identify antibodies in a patient's blood (to avoid 
potentially fatal reactions when transfusing blood).  This task has the classical characteristics of an 
abduction task, including masking and problems with noisy data.<P>

<H2>THE STUDENTS</H2>
Students participating in the study were in the Medical Technology Program at a major U. S. university.  
These students were college juniors and had completed the didactic portion of their immunohematology 
coursework and an associated student lab, but had not yet begun their clinical rotation.  Participation in 
the study was voluntary, but the students were paid for their participation.<P>

<H2>TUTORING APPROACH</H2>
The approach to tutoring we chose to explore is the design of a problem-based learning environment in 
which the computer plays an active role in tutoring the student.  TMT is an active coaching system that 
allows the student to get practice solving realistic cases within a computer-supported environment and 
provides coaching in the form of suggested problem-solving strategies, immediate feedback in response to 
errors made by students, and a case summary (at the end of each case), indicating how an expert would 
solve that particular case.<P>

<H2>INTERFACE DESIGN ISSUES</H2>
A major contributor to the success of TMT are the issues surrounding the design of the interface.  The 
interface design makes explicit to the computer the student's thought processes.  The very tools that 
allow the student do their antibody identification task are the same tools that let the computer monitor 
what the student is doing.  Unlike many tutoring systems that inform the student that he or she has made 
errors only after the student has com-pleted the problem on which he or she is working, TMT critiques 
the student's process <I>during</I> the process of solving an antibody identification case, providing the 
student with immediate, context-sensitive feedback when he or she makes an error.<P>
<P>

TMT's interface also makes explicit to the teacher the student's thought processes.  This system is a 
cooperative system meant to support rather than replace the teacher. The interface design provides the 
teacher with data that allows her to potentially diagnose problems at a deeper level than the computer.  
The teacher is able to look at the computer displays and identify where in the task the student is 
encountering difficulty.  The teacher is also able to pull up a summary of the student's work on each case, 
allowing for a more complete diagnosis of the student's process and progress.<P>
<P>

The TMT interface design allows the student to control the problem-solving activities, selecting tests to 
run, and marking conclusions as desired.  This system allows for direct manipulation [4], providing a clear 
mapping between the goals of the task and the representation on the screen.  The interface design also 
supports cognitive limitations of students by providing memory and perceptual aids.<P>

<H2>SYSTEM EVALUATION</H2>
Throughout the literature of computer-based tutoring systems, there is very little evidence of rigorous 
evaluation of expert systems in education.  Thus, one of the goals of this work was to provide a case 
study demonstrating methods for understanding the impact of such a system on teaching and learning.<P>
<P>

Thirty students in the Medical Technology Program at a major U. S. university were tested on TMT.  
The setting consisted of the laboratory in which the students normally conducted their student lab work.  
Each student worked individually on a computer.<P>
<P>

The students were randomly assigned to two groups, where half of the students used a version of the 
system with all tutoring functions turned off except for summaries (of how an expert would have solved 
the case) at the end of each case (the control group).  The other half used a version with all the tutoring 
functions turned on and were also provided with instructor assistance (the treatment group).  Performance 
was studied using a combination of a within-  and between-subject design, using an initial pre-test case, 
and two post-test cases.<P>
<P>

The results showed that there was no significant difference in the misdiagnosis rates on the Pre-test Case 
for the Control and Treatment Groups.  However, the students in the Treatment Group showed a 
significant (p &lt; .001) improvement in performance (a reduction from 100% to 13% misdiagnosis error 
rate) from the Pre-test Case to the matched Post-test Case (Evaluation Case 1).  Students in the Control 
Group showed no significant difference in their misdiagnosis rate from the Pre-test to Post-test Case 
1.<P>
<P>

The between-subjects analysis also showed significant improvement  in performance on the Post-test 
Cases across the two groups.  On Post-test Case 1, subjects in the Treatment Group had a misdiagnosis 
rate of 13% while subjects in the Control Group had a misdiagnosis rate of 73%.  On Post-test Case 2, 
students in the Treatment Group had a 7% misdiagnosis rate, while students in the Control Group had a 
73% misdiagnosis rate.  Each of these differences is significant (p &lt; 0.01).<P>
<P>

Additional analyses are being conducted using videotapes showing the interactions of students with the 
system and with the instructor.<P>

<H2>CONCLUSIONS</H2>
We have developed an expert critiquing system that is based on a model of expert problem-solving in the 
domain of antibody identification.  This system provides a task environment to give medical technology 
students practice in problem-solving, detects errors during the course of such problem-solving, provides 
timely feedback directly to the student, and supports the immediate intervention by a teacher in order to 
supplement the tutoring provided by the computer.  The underlying design features (for example, the 
design of an interface that makes it possible for both the computer and the teacher to monitor the 
student's process and progress) are major contributors to the success of the system.  The data strongly 
indicate that TMT is a viable solution for improving medical technology students' performance on the real 
world medical diagnosis task of antibody identification.<P>
