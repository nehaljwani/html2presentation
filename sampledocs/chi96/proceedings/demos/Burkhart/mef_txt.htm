<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
Process flows are difficult to communicate to customers effectively,
particularly if they are complex or involve multiple systems.  We introduce
some animation techniques that we rapidly prototyped so that systems
engineering or system design proposals or decisions can be effectively
communicated to customers.
<h2>Keywords</h2>
Animation, visualization, simulation, prototyping, process flow.

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
Creating a solution for our customers usually involves the engineering and
design (and implementation) of large scale software systems.  These software
solutions often involve multiple systems that are either new or provide new
interfaces to existing systems.  Prior to determining a mutually agreeable
solution, a significant amount of time is spent in meetings to outline a
high-level design proposal that addresses the issue.  These meetings typically
include a few subject matter experts who put together a system design proposal,
e.g., a process flow of the solution.  Recently, our expertise was requested to
help engineers and customers better visualize these proposed system design
solutions.  Our strategy was to use computer-generated animation to communicate
process flows to customers or potential users in a manner which is easy to
comprehend.
<p>
These process flows usually involve complex interactions among various
computing systems (new operations systems, existing systems, and databases, for
example). In our environment, the typical method for communicating these
complex process flows is a diagram (e.g., an architecture diagram or data flow
diagram) that contains the many components of the proposed solution with
interfaces shown by lines and the direction of flow shown by arrows.  These
diagrams typically must be explained in-person by an engineer in order to be
fully understood.  In addition, sometimes the lines depicting the interfaces
are numbered to indicate the order of the flows.
The more complex these diagrams become, the harder it can be for
our customers to understand the overall solution.  (When they focus on
individual parts, they can lose sight of the whole solution.)<p>
We have found that using animation is an effective way to communicate concepts
which may otherwise be difficult to visualize.  The animations that we
developed show the interconnections or interfaces among the various systems or
system components by simulating a flow of information from one component to
another.  The order of the flows is inherent in the animation.  Triggers that
cause the initiation of flows are also shown in our animations, and where the
trigger is user input, we have incorporated user interface prototypes in our
animation sequences.  We have found this to be a very useful technique for
demonstrating process flows, particularly to clients who want a conceptual
understanding of a complex solution.  Process flow visualization also enables
engineers or designers to detect inefficiencies or bottlenecks in the flow,
since they are very apparent and can result in repetitive loops.
<h2>RECENT USES IN OTHER DOMAINS</h2>
A recent review of the literature shows that this visualization approach has
been used in a variety of areas.  The key questions that visualization is
addressing across multiple domains are: "What might it look like?" and "What
are the impacts?"  Ervin (1992) has used three-dimensional simulations to link
Geographical Information System (GIS) data and environmental models for
visualizing design proposals to study the environmental impact of these designs
[1].  Hall (1993) also used computer visualization for assisting the control of
urban design by planning authorities and studying the impact of proposed
developments [2].  Jenvey (1994) reports on the use of multimedia (i.e.,
computer graphic simulations) in an electrical engineering course on the study
of electromagnetics to enable students to visualize what is invisible (e.g.,
voltages, currents)[3].  Jenvey claims this approach proved to be a great
instructional aid to students who sometimes have a difficult time connecting
theory and measurement.<p>
Each of these cases demonstrate the efficacy of using computer visualizations
to enable people to view what is sometimes difficult to understand, assess the
impact of proposed design solutions, and improve the quality of decision
making.  Our animations provided similar results from users.
<h2>OUR DEMONSTRATIONS</h2>
Our demonstrations show several examples of computer animations we developed
[rapidly] to enable our customers to visualize our proposed solution to their
problem.  Our technique sometimes involves the design of a prototypical
Graphical User Interface (GUI) that triggers the process flow or helps to
communicate interactions within the process flow.  We will provide examples of
both a system-to-system flow and one in which system-to-system flows are
integrated with user interface prototypes.  Technical staff and technical
managers from our customer organizations were the intended audience for these
animations.
<p>
Our last example demonstrates a visualization which was incorporated into a
multimedia marketing presentation.  Top level executives were the intended
audience for this presentation.  Because this was a marketing presentation, it
offers different examples of level of detail and concreteness (e.g., less
detail on systems and more realism to enable the audience to relate the flow to
actual world events, such as viewing a movie-on-demand).  This presentation
depicts a customer-oriented service delivery scenario, i.e., it focuses on the
customer in their home requesting a particular video service via the TV.  It
presents the issues involved in delivering a broadband-based video service to a
customer, and includes a brief animation showing interactions among several
systems, that make this delivery solution possible.
<p>
The simulations we developed were designed as standalone applications and
provide a rather simple user interface for the user to control the flow of the
animations.  Even though the animations were designed in an intuitive manner,
they required some training to operate.  To facilitate training we created an
intuitive interface with a look-and-feel with which the user might be familiar.
For all of the animations we developed, we required feedback from our users and
incorporated that feedback in our iterative design process.
<h2>INTEGRATING PROCESS FLOW ANIMATION WITH GUI PROTOTYPING</h2>
If process flows are a result of user actions, integrating an animated process
flow with a user interface prototype can help in further describing to
customers how a given user action will result in underlying system processing
and flow-through to other related systems.
<p>
In our second demonstration we incorporated a GUI by prototyping it and
interspersing GUI inputs and outputs at the appropriate points in the
processing flow of the system.  This provided our customers a more realistic
view of the system, and how background processes would be started and, more
importantly, at what point.  Within the GUI we keyed the background processing
animation windows to appear when the user selected the "Help" button in the
appropriate window or dialog box of the GUI.  If the user has an understanding
of the underlying processing, the animation windows could be considered as a
processing indicator (or processing status display) in the delivered system.
<p>
The animations were designed to run automatically; however, the user had the
option to control the flow of the animation with special commands we built into
the system.  This control provided the presenter with the flexibility to review
critical flows or emphasize specific sections of it to the customer.  For the
animations and the GUI design prototypes we developed, we required feedback
from our users and incorporated that feedback in our iterative design process.
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
We feel that we have been providing a service of great value to our customers
(both the systems engineers designing these solutions and their customers) by
utilizing computer animation techniques in the early stage of a high-level
design proposal.  Viewers of the system have expressed immense satisfaction
with the ability of these animations to communicate complex process flows or
hard-to-visualize material effectively.  Furthermore, all of these cases
demonstrate the efficacy of using computer visualizations to reduce the cost
and improve the quality of technical communication.  Viewers are able to easily
understand complex process flows, assess the impact of proposed design
solutions, and the quality of decisions regarding the proposed solution is
improved.
