<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>
<p>
Visage is a prototype user interface environment for 
exploring and analyzing information. It represents an 
approach to  coordinating visualizations and analytical 
tools  in data-intensive domains. Visage is based on an 
information-centric approach to user interface design 
which strives to eliminate impediments to direct user 
access to information objects across applications and 
visualizations. Visage consists of a set of data 
manipulation operations, an intelligent system for 
generating a wide variety of data visualizations and a 
briefing tool that supports the conversion of visual 
displays used during exploration into  interactive 
presentation slides. <p>

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
We are developing an approach to information 
exploration [1] based on an evolving software 
environment called Visage with the goal of creating four 
important component capabilities:
<ol>
<li>Dynamically generated information visualizations.
<li>Interactive tools for performing basic information 
	manipulation operations.
<li>An information-centric paradigm by which users 
	interact with data and applications.
<li>A fully integrated presentation and briefing 
environment.
</ol><p>
<p>The VISAGE user interface paradigm takes an 
aggressively information-centric approach to the 
presentation of information to the user. The information-
centric approach is the next logical step along the path 
from application-centric  architectures to the modern 
document-centric  approach. The distinctions among the 
three approaches hinges on differences in the "basic 
currency" through which the users interact with the 
system.
<p>In application-centric architectures, the basic 
currency is the file. With the introduction of graphical 
user interfaces and the desktop metaphor, files became 
concrete visual objects, directly manipulable by the 
user, storable on the desktop or in folders, and--to a 
limited extent--arrangable by users and software in 
semantically meaningful ways.  But the contents of 
those files were still out of direct reach of the user.  
With the document-centric interface paradigms the basic 
currency is no longer the file, but rather the document.  
The application's role is subordinated and the user 
focuses on direct manipulations of documents; users can 
almost literally "get their hands on" their documents.
<p>The information-centric approach represented in 
Visage simply is a natural continuation of these trends. 
Visage abandons the primacy of the document wrapper 
as the central focus of user interaction in favor of the 
data element as the basic currency of the interface. 
Visage permits direct drag-and-drop manipulation of data 
elements at any level of granularity. A numeric entry in 
a table, selected bars from a bar chart, and a complex 
presentation graphic are all first-class candidates for user 
manipulations.
<p>Hints of this approach may be found in a few 
existing interfaces; recent versions of Microsoft Word 
support the ability of the user to drag selected text from 
one place in the document to another. In Visage, this 
capability is promoted from a special-purpose feature to 
a ubiquitously available capability that can be used 
everywhere in the environment. It becomes part of the 
interface 'physic', empowering the user to perform 
directly unique actions that usually require knowledge of 
specialized interface "features."
<P><H2>AN EXAMPLE</H2>
<p>In order to convey the basic elements of Visage, it is 
useful to consider some simple displays and operations 
in a detailed example. The example is based on one of 
the possible applications of this approach, and uses the 
next generation logistics tracking and planning systems. 
These systems are being developed  to enable analysts 
to access information about the location, quantities, 
status, transportation, distribution, consumption of 
equipment and supplies and the people who need them 
worldwide. One of many displays that can be produced 
in the Visage environment is an outliner-style table. It 
provides a hierarchical perspective on tabular data and 
illustrates drill-down and roll-up capabilities in a 
familiar way.
<p>
<p><h3>Drill-down as a data-navigation 
technique</h3>
<p>Starting from any point in a data network users are 
offered a menu of alternative dimensions along which 
they may drill down. The user can choose to drill down 
further by selecting any of the relations from the pop-up 
menu, dynamically attached to the unit on which further 
information is desired, giving a more detailed 
organizational breakdown. This drill-down process can 
also occur across different  relations. For example, it is 
possible for a user to drill-down from a division to the 
equipment it possesses and then from one type of 
equipment to the parts or supplies it requires and then to 
all the units that require a particular supply type. This is 
a process of turning a network or web of relations into a 
convenient hierarchical breakdown for navigational 
purposes. Users can select any attribute of the objects in 
the hierarchy that they want to have displayed, like its 
echelon or the number of people in the unit. As the 
hierarchy is expanded, the data attributes are expanded 
with it. Dynamic drill-down and expression of attribute 
values are fundamental in Visage and occur in all 
displays.
<p><h3>Information-centric Data 
Manipulation</h3>
<p>An important operation in this information-centric 
interface approach [2] is the movement or transfer of 
information throughout the Visage environment. Objects 
representing information are moved directly in groups or 
individually among visualization and application 
interfaces. In order to display some of the attributes of 
these units graphically, one simply drags the unit names 
from the outliner to an empty bar chart display. In this 
case, a bar chart shows the weight of supplies that the 
units require. Displaying unit supply weights in a bar 
chart makes it easy to select units requiring the most 
supplies - those with the longest bars. Focusing on the 
units with highest supply weights provides an opportunity 
to display the locations of just these units on a map, 
perhaps to determine the locations where supply points 
should be established. Units are dragged and dropped, 
same as before, to a map application. The map 
application is a product called MATT which was 
developed prior to and independently of Visage by Bolt, 
Beranek and Newman. This is an example of one of the  
primary goals of this work: to provide the mortar 
necessary to cement separately developed analysis tools 
into what the user will experience as an integrated work 
environment. By default, a map display shows 
longitude/latitude attributes of objects and the unit's 
associated military symbology.
<p><h3>Coordinated Data Highlighting</h3>
<p>By color highlighting (painting) a subset of units 
that occur close together in the center of the map, for 
example, (perhaps to identify a region where large 
quantities of supplies will be needed) multiple displays 
may be visually coordinated. Notice that painting an 
object in one display causes it to be similarly colored in 
all other displays. Together, the three displays show the 
selected units, the supplies they need, and where they 
are located.
<p><h3>Roll-up (Aggregation)</h3>
<p>Finally, this small subset of units can be rolled-up 
(i.e. aggregated) into a single object and named by a 
user, in this case, "Task Force A." It appears in the 
bottom of the outliner and its attributes are the 
appropriate totals of the those for the units it aggregates.  
The new aggregate can be treated as a single object for 
new drill-down operations. This new entity can then be 
drilled down to show other units, their support, inventory 
or other information. Note that this approach enables 
users to compose a complex query through a series of 
drill-down, drag, paint and roll-up operations.  The last 
aggregate representing those units of a division which 
need the "most" supplies and are located in a small 
region to the north. In Visage such complex queries may 
be composed entirely by direct manipulation.
<p><h3>Sage - Automatic Graphic Generation</h3>
<p>Also shown here is Sage, a knowledge-based 
presentation system that designs displays combining 
diverse information (e.g. quantitative, relational, 
temporal, hierarchical, categorical, geographic). We use 
Sage to automatically assume the burden of visualizing 
information for other applications and for computer-
supported graphic design, especially for large data sets. 
Complete integration between Visage and Sage is the 
our goal during the next year.
<p><h3>Interactive Presentations</h3>
<p>The Visage environment has a simple briefing  or 
"slide show" feature completely integrated with the rest 
of the application. As analyses are performed, text and 
graphics can be captured and saved in special frames 
called 'slides.'  A slide is simple a frame designed to 
make it easy to "paste up" other frames and elements for 
visual presentations. The user simply "drags and drops" 
the desired displays onto the slide frame, where they are 
scaled appropriately. Note that elements on the slide do 
not lose their separate identity--they are still fully-
functional interface objects that can be used for further 
analysis--even in the middle of a briefing. Collections of 
frames are accumulated in a "slide sorter" frame, used to 
sequence a presentation by simple drag operations, and 
the sequential display of each slide at full-screen size. 
Thus, the briefing function has been seamlessly 
integrated with those of data exploration and analysis.
