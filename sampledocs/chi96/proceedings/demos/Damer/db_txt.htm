<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>

<P>
The emergence of standards such as <A HREF="http://vrml.wired.com/vrml.tech/">Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML)</A>
has made shared, three dimensional virtual spaces available to
the greater Internet community. When these spaces become inhabited
by representations of people, often referred to as<I> digital
actors</I> or <I>avatars</I>, a whole spectrum of social behavior
will emerge. Prototypes of inhabited digital spaces have been
hosted on the Internet since early 1995. Enough experience has
been gained with these systems to produce an initial benchmark
of their effectiveness from a user interface standpoint. Observation
of social interaction in these spaces has also provided some interesting
insights. A key finding is that there is a need for interdisciplinary
collaboration between the technologists building digital worlds
and specialists in community and social behavior.

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

<P>
The inhabited digital space is a newly emerging medium of human
interaction. This medium is born of the combination of two technologies,
virtual reality and text-based chat environments such as Multi-User
Domains (MUDs). Virtual reality has brought real-time three dimensional
scenes to life on commonly available computer hardware. A growing
number of MUDs and other text-based chat environments have brought
a novel form of interactive community to users on networks such
as the Internet. Several prototypes which combine elements of
graphical virtual reality and text chat are now being hosted on
the Internet. These prototypes allow users to manipulate a digital
actor or avatar in the graphical space while communicating with
others (also represented by avatars) using a text-based chat interface.
<H2>THE PROTOTYPES TESTED AND UNDER STUDY</H2>

<P>
Members of  the Contact Consortium have been testing and studying
several of these prototypes since early 1995. Prototypes tested
include <A HREF="http://www.worlds.net">WorldsChat</A> [1] (Figure
1) and <A HREF="http://www.worlds.net">Alpha World</A> [2]. Systems
under study include <A HREF="http://www.sics.se/dce/dive/dive.html">Distributed Interactive Virtual Environment (DIVE)</A>
[3], Starbright World [4], and <A HREF="http://www.ossi.com/Worldsaway/away.html">Worlds Away</A>
[5]. Some of the prototypes examined are scheduled for release
as commercial services. We expect that there will be an increased
number of these systems available on the Internet in 1996. We
hope that this benchmark will engage the interest of researchers
and other contributors before the medium extends to the mainstream
of computer users. 
<H4>Testing methodology</H4>

<P>
WorldsChat and Alpha World were tested extensively. To test, members
of the Consortium would enter a pre-arranged area in the virtual
world with agreed upon avatars and name badges. Cooperative walk-throughs
of the spaces were tried to test the ease of navigation and following
ability. Conversations were carried out between testers and other
users in the environment. Interaction with novice and experienced
users was carried out to gage their impressions of both the medium
and its usefulness for interaction. Numerous screen shots were
taken of typical social situations. Video was shot of one session
in WorldsChat. Starbright World (still under development) was
studied from videotaped sessions supplied by its designers. DIVE
and Worlds Away were studied from the available literature and
World Wide Web documentation and images.
<H4>Technical and user interface criteria</H4>

<P>
The prototypes had limitations in both performance and user interface.
However, due to their use of a natural, point-of-view metaphor,
they were surprisingly easy to navigate and engage other users
in interaction. Very little in the way of user training was necessary.
Often, veteran users would coach new arrivals. The technical and
user interface criteria tested included:
<OL>
<LI>Appearance and rendering performance of graphics
<LI>Avatar appearance and design (range of choices, badging, distance
appearance, articulation or animation)
<LI>Ease, options for avatar motion (degrees of freedom)
<LI>Ease of communication (text chat, body language)
<LI>Effectiveness of controls and services (doors, stairs, walkways,
rooms, signage, coordinate readouts)
<LI>Server crowd control effectiveness (speed of rendering other
avatars, collision detection)
<LI>Ability of users to alter the space (object moving and assembly,
building construction, message posting)
<LI>Special features offered in the world space (custom design
of avatars, community newspaper, feedback facilities)
</OL>

<P>

<H4>Observations of interactions</H4>

<P>
Observations of social interaction within these virtual worlds
posed some challenges. We found that the lack of a number of important
social cues lead to frequent misunderstandings between users.
Observation focused on:
<OL>
<LI>Tracking threads of conversation between individuals
<LI>Noting differences in interaction between the observer and
newcomers or veteran participants
<LI>Observing occurrences of aggression or cooperation, either
communicated through text or by motion of the users' avatars
<LI>Interaction with participants on their reactions to the environment
and its effectiveness
<LI>Observing the use of special terms in the environment
</OL>

<H2>CONCLUSIONS</H2>

<P>
While the early prototypes suffered from both user interface and
communication limitations, we were able to carry out meaningful
interaction within these digital spaces. This medium may become
effective as a tool for social interaction and cooperative work.
Some initial areas in need of improvement are discussed below.
<P>
Improved graphics rendering and server crowd control speed would
reduce the effort required to navigate and approach other avatars
for interaction. Auditory cues when collisions occur would reduce
confusion. Finally, a set of simple, standard interface cues for
navigating in virtual space would be very useful. Some suggestion
of how these cues might work is discussed by Slater, Usoh, and
Steed in [6].
<P>
There are limitations that prevent the full expression of interaction,
for example, because avatars are not unique to each user, it is
difficult to distinguish between strangers and familiar users.
Lastly lacking a  means to identify who is involved in a conversation
leads to frequent inadvertent interruptions. Some of these issues
are addressed by Benford, Bowers, Lennart, and Greenhalgh in [3].
<P>
To facilitate improvements and overcome these limitations, we
feel that there is a need for strong inter-disciplinary cooperation.
Of particular importance is the involvement of social scientists
and specialists in community in the process of design and testing
of this emerging new medium of human interaction.
