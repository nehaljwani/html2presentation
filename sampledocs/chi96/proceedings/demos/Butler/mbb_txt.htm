<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>

<P>This demonstration will show how we have built a collection of Lotus
Notes databases containing usability results and techniques. Because we
have these databases available, we can easily research past testing results,
share information on common UI artifacts with geographically dispersed
development teams, and efficiently develop strategies for testing new products
and features. The intent of this demonstration is to show the characteristics
of our system of databases that we find most important for supporting our
work, and how our workgroup solution helps us accomplish our goals.</P>

<H2>BACKGROUND</H2>

<P>Usability testing is a well-established technique in many development
organizations today. Indeed, many usability organizations have been testing
for several years, and have collected substantial bodies of data related
to their products and competitive products.</P>

<P>Most PC software products today share common UI elements: these are
dictated both by GUI standards (e.g., Windows standards), and, in many
cases, by the company's product line standards. Growth of the &quot;suite&quot;
market among PC office products requires companies to ensure that their
products have common UI elements that work well across the product line.
This becomes a particular challenge when development groups are geographically
dispersed: ensuring consistency requires a variety of clear communication
channels.</P>

<P>In addition, all development organizations face continuing demands to
rapidly update their software: for usability organizations, this means
finding fast and effective ways to test and deliver results.</P>

<P>At Lotus, we've spent the last several years developing a system of
Lotus Notes databases that help us meet all of these challenges: we have
organized our findings and methods, and they are quickly accessible to
design teams throughout the world. While we have used Lotus Notes to support
our system, we think the general model of databases that we have established
could be re-created using other workgroup tools.</P>

<H2>WHAT IS LOTUS NOTES</H2>

<P>Lotus Notes is a client-server product that is a combination of a messaging
system, a document-management database, and an application-development
environment. Lotus Notes provides easy form generation tools, for users
with no programming experience. Users can develop &quot;views&quot; of
databases to sort and display data in whatever format is appropriate for
their needs. Databases can be replicated world-wide, allowing people across
the globe to have access to current information in a secure delivery system.</P>

<P>At Lotus, all employees have access to Lotus Notes as both an E-mail
and a database package. Lotus Notes databases share similar user interface
conventions, so if a user is familiar with one database, she can quickly
become accustomed to using other databases. [1]</P>

<H2>KEY ELEMENTS OF OUR SYSTEM</H2>

<P>To support usability testing, and the sharing of usability findings
across our company we use a series of related Lotus Notes databases. The
most important of these include:</P>

<H3>Product Specifications Databases</H3>

<P>Each product team maintains current product plans on secure databases.
While not accessible to the whole company, all product team members, and
members of related product teams usually have access. These databases include
complete descriptions of all product features, including screen shots of
feature elements, such as dialog boxes and menus. Some workflow features
are used to indicate versioning of changes to each description. Usability
specialists and designers can review specifications of their own and related
products to plan usability testing based on these detailed product descriptions.</P>

<H3>Testing Results Database</H3>

<P>Usability testing results are stored centrally in one database that
is accessible to teams across the company. This database includes copies
of test results from testing done at Lotus for the last four years. Test
results are categorized for easiest searching; full-text searching is also
enabled for more ad-hoc investigations. Usability specialists and product
designers can search past testing results to see if usability issues have
been addressed in related products, or to investigate issues that should
be addressed in upcoming releases of products.</P>

<P>All test results are stored as rich text documents. This allows usability
specialists to explain usability findings by including screen shots to
illustrate the key points.</P>

<P>This database also contains all test plans, test tasks, and test files
for all tests done in the last four years. Having past tests available
enables us to re-use plans for efficiency, repeat tests to determine whether
usability has been improved by design changes, and use tests from related
products as a starting point for planning.</P>

<H3>Usability Results Tracking Databases</H3>

<P>Individual usability specialists maintain databases to track usability
issues. These databases are based on a common tracking database template,
but are customized to meet the needs of individual products and product
teams. Usability specialists use these databases to monitor activities
on key usability issues and ensure that these are addressed in the development
cycle.</P>

<H3>Usability Tools Database</H3>

<P>We store detailed information on testing techniques, use of lab equipment,
standardized testing forms, and other instructional materials in one central
database. This provides a resource to train new usability testing specialists
and non-specialists who get involved with testing on special projects.</P>

<H3>Potential Subjects Database</H3>

<P>By continuously recruiting users who are willing to participate in usability
testing, we have a ready pool of people to draw on, allowing us to quickly
schedule testing. Our subject database includes detailed information on
hundreds of users (of both our products and competitive products). We track
address information, details about which products testing candidates use,
which features they use, and their general level of expertise. We have
designed a number of specialized search tools to help us locate users who
we know we typically need for testing. This database is also full-text
indexed to allow for ad-hoc searches. In addition, we can use this database
to track all contact with each user, record testing activity by each user,
and generate confirmation letters which can be faxed directly from our
desktops, using Lotus Notes, to the user's location.</P>

<H3>E-mail</H3>

<P>Lotus Notes databases are well-integrated with rich-text electronic
mail. We can easily distribute to pre-established mailing lists either
the full text of usability testing reports, or links that enable users
to quickly jump to the correct record in the appropriate database. Because
the E-mail system is rich-text, we can also conduct on-line discussions
of features by including screen shots of feature elements to illustrate
the discussion.</P>

<H2>SUMMARY</H2>

<P>Using related and commonly accessible database tools has enabled us
to make more efficient use of our usability testing results. Maintaining
a well-organized system of results, test plans, and techniques means that
we can share information across the company, quickly draw on existing findings
to plan areas for future testing, and use existing tools to speed the test
development process.</P>
