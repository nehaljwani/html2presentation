<H3>Workshop Description</H3>
Usability research findings can contribute strategically to the definition of a product family during early planning and design.  Rather than waiting for user-testing of prototypes, we can learn about user task habits, preferences, and concerns to identify product opportunities and help define a product's business direction and market positioning.  Early usability research methods can collect specific user data needed to plan the product scope, a compelling feature set, and early design prototypes.<P>

This workshop expands on the organizers' previous CHI tutorials to explore how practitioners apply early and iterative usability research as a strategic tool:  partnering with other groups in our companies, building cross-functional teams of usability, marketing, development, and support people.<P>

The workshop brings together practitioners who have:

<UL><LI>Incorporated iterative usability research into the phases of the product planning and development process<P>

<LI>Evaluated the trade-offs of investing limited usability resources during these phases<P>

<LI>Tried to establish usability research processes and findings as contributors to the strategic planning efforts in their organizations<P>

<LI>Attempted to build cross-functional teams to achieve this vision</UL><P>

Workshop participants have prepared papers describing their organizational environments, what they have done to integrate usability research into their company's strategic planning, what methods they used, and how well their efforts worked.  During the workshop, participants will discuss the papers, and use them to create a list of issues and questions that relate to the workshop topic.<P>

By discussing this issues list, the participants will design a <I>model process</I> for how to integrate usability research into companies' strategic planning.  This model process will include both likely successful paths, based on our participants' experiences, and pitfalls to avoid.   After the workshop, the organizers will write a report on the workshop for publication in the SIGCHI Bulletin.<BR><P>
