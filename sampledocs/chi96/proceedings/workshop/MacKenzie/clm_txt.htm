<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
In all synthetic environment systems, the basic components are a human
operator, a machine, and a human-machine interface linking the human
operator to the machine.  In teleoperator systems, the machine is an
electromechanical tool containing sensors and actuators that effectively
extend the sensorimotor system of the operator, allowing the sensing and
manipulating of the physical environment.  In virtual reality, the machine
is a programmed computer that synthesizes or generates virtual worlds with
which the user can interact.  In augmented reality, the synthetic world
overlays the physical one, enhancing the user's interaction. (Durlach &
Mavor, 1995).  In considering grasping and manipulations of physical,
virtual and augmented objects in such systems, there are commonalities.
<H2>THEME</H2>
In keeping with the 1996 conference theme of Common Ground, the theme for
this workshop will be Searching for Common Ground in Manipulation of
Virtual Environments among those individuals working with manipulation of
virtual objects.  Regardless of the scale and conditions of the environment
to be manipulated (e.g., microsurgery, remote manipulation on space
stations), there are elemental problems in viewing perspective, action
selection, task and trajectory planning, obstacle avoidance, grasping,
object characteristics, task constraints, physical laws, mechanics of
manipulation, contacts and compliance, co-ordinate transformations,
representation and rendering.
<H2>GOALS</H2>
The goals of this workshop on Manipulation in Virtual Environments are:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
to identify common ground, common issues, common misconceptions, common
problems,
<LI>
to provide opportunities for learning from one another, collaboration,
sharing solutions,
<LI>
to develop the beginnings of a common vocabulary for more effective
communication, and
<LI>
to identify future directions, for research and application.
</OL>
<P>
The workshop will provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to
share their issues and insights, and to develop a common vocabulary in this
rapidly developing area.  The workshop report will update CHI members on
the state-of-the-art for manipulation in virtual environments.
<H2>WORKSHOP STRUCTURE</H2>
The workshop will be one full day, in the conference hotel. Starting with a
series of ice breakers and familiarizations, the workshop will consist of:
small group breakouts, presentations summarizing the main points covered in
the small groups, and whole group discussions.  Based on the participants'
statements, specific topics, problems and questions will be addressed in
these breakouts.
<P>
After the workshop, a workshop summary talk and poster will be presented at
the CHI 96 conference, a report will be produced for the SIGCHI Bulletin
and other information made available on the WWW.
