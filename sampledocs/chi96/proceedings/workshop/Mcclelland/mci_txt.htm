<H2><FONT FACE="Times">THEME AND RELEVANCE </FONT><BR>
</H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The human computer interaction (HCI) community has
a long association with the development of user centred design principles
(UCD) and usability engineering. In fact it could be said that user centred
design is, together with the opportunities offered by computer technology,
the prime driver in developing the HCI field. We would like to review the
extent to which UCD principles and working practices are an established
part of system and product development processes within industry. </FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">There are several reasons why we think it is worth
re-examining this issue. There has been a dramatic increase in the dependency
of advanced industrialised societies on computer use. There is now apparently
general acceptance within industry that system usability is a key objective.
</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">But the most challenging development is the application
of digital technologies which is continually breaking into new spheres
of use. Consequently business environments are rapidly evolving: new markets,
new market players, new types of products, new user groups, which raise
different issues from those traditionally confronted in the computer industry:</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">- the qualities we design to; social/cultural dimensions,
pleasure of ownership and use, status, fun, enjoyment etc. are being added
to the traditional usability concerns (&quot;quality of use&quot; - ISO
9241 pt 11),</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">- the new skills coming into the multidisciplinary
design teams; interaction designers, engineering designers, writers, animators,
sound designers as well as software engineering.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">- the development of new working practices.</FONT></P>

<H2><FONT FACE="Times"><B>WORKSHOP GOAL</B> </FONT><BR>
</H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">The workshop will examine how far industry has incorporated
user-centred design principles into their product and system development
processes. Issues to be explored include:</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">- how far are UCD principles recognised as relevant
to the business objectives? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">- how far are UCD practices in need of adaptation
as the &quot;usability issue&quot; becomes more widely applied to many
product areas beyond traditional areas of HCI? </FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">By working in groups during the workshop we plan
to identify:</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">- the key components required for an effective and
successful UCD process, </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">- the essential skill bases (established and emerging),</FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">- the enablers and constraints associated with managing
&quot;quality of use&quot; in practice.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">It is intended that the results of this workshop
will be reported in the SIGCHI bulletin and/or Interactions.</FONT> </P>

<H2><B><FONT FACE="Times">PARTICIPANTS</FONT></B><BR>
</H2>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">20 participants from following groups will be invited:
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">- specialists (HF, Usability, HCI, etc.) directly
engaged in product or system development in industry,</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">- consultants in the industrial application of UCD
practices</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">- researchers investigating UCD practices in industry.</FONT>
