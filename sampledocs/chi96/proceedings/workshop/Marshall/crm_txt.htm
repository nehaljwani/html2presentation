<H2>OVERVIEW </H2>  
  
<P>What kind of work will CHI professionals be doing in ten  
years? What will be the key issues and research questions  
addressed at CHI 06 -- assuming that the CHI community will  
still exist and will be sponsoring a conference in ten years?  
How can the CHI community create and sustain common ground  
today that will help it thrive and make important  
contributions in 2006 and beyond? </P>  
  
<P>At the CHI'95 Doctoral Consortium, students and faculty  
worked on a brief exercise in which they considered what the  
CHI field will be like in ten years. The results of that  
exercise will be combined with position papers submitted by  
workshop participants to provide a starting point for this  
activity. Scenario development techniques similar to those  
used for corporate strategic planning [1] will then be  
employed to further expand and organize workshop  
participants' thinking about the future of CHI. </P>  
  
<H2>WORKSHOP GOALS </H2>  
  
<P>The first goal of this workshop is to create and document  
a set of three scenarios that describe alternative futures  
based on the following questions: </P>  
  
<UL>  
  
<LI>What will be the state of the CHI community in the year  
2006? </LI>  
  
<LI>What kind of work will the members of that community be  
doing? </LI>  
  
<LI>What will they consider to be the key issues and  
research questions of the day? </LI>  
  
<LI>What will be the nature of the social and technological  
context in which their work will occur? </LI>  
  
<LI>What educational preparation and work experience will  
characterize a successful CHI professional? </LI>  
  
<LI>What body of knowledge and set of skills will form the  
common ground of the field? </LI>  
  
</UL>  
  
<P>The second goal of the workshop will be to use the  
scenarios to address further the subject of common ground.  
</P>  
  
<H2>ACTIVITY PLAN AND EXPECTED RESULTS </H2>  
  
<P>The workshop will last one day. Prior to the workshop,  
the organizers will identify key factors and prepare skeleton  
scenarios based on position papers and email contributions of  
workshop participants. During the workshop, participants will  
alternate between small-group breakout sessions and  
whole-group reporting and discussion sessions to expand,  
modify and identify implications of these scenarios. </P>  
  
<P>The results of this workshop will be (1) a set of  
scenarios describing possible future states of the CHI  
community and its work and (2) ideas for creating and  
sustaining common ground that will prepare the CHI community  
for a successful future. Workshop participants will  
collaborate during and after the conference to communicate,  
apply and extend these results. Current plans for  
communicating with the CHI community include some form of  
presentation at CHI 96, a SIGCHI Bulletin report, and a  
World-Wide Web document. </P>  
  
<P>The results of this workshop should be of interest to  
educators and managers involved in the development of CHI  
professionals, as well as to researchers and practitioners  
planning for their careers or future programs of work. In  
addition, this workshop and the dissemination of its results  
should contribute to the common ground of the CHI community.
