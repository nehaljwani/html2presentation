<h3>ABSTRACT</h3><p>
This tutorial provides a &quot;hands-on&quot; (actually, 
&quot;minds-on&quot;) exploration of  several basic processes and 
phenomena of human memory, and problem solving.  The emphasis 
is on developing both intuitive and formal knowledge which can 
serve as background knowledge which will be useful in interpreting 
design guidelines and in making educated design judgments when 
design guidelines fail, conflict, or are nonexistent.  The 
demonstrations used emphasize basic general phenomena with which 
any theory of memory or problem solving must deal.  In addition, 
the tutorial suggests some of the implications of these phenomena for 
designing interactive computing systems.<p>

<h3>KEYWORDS:</h3>  Memory, Problem Solving, Design, Models of 
the User <p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION AND CAVEATS</h3><p>
The emphasis in this tutorial is on demonstrations and exercises 
which highlight some of the quite remarkable things human beings 
do in interacting with, in learning about, and in making sense out of 
the world around them.  These things often seem to be quite 
ordinary simply because we do them regularly, often without 
deliberation.  Nonetheless, some of them are quite complex and not 
well understood.  Many of the demonstrations replicate phenomena 
studied under controlled laboratory conditions and some are drawn 
directly from research studies.<p>

Since this tutorial emphasizes the development of an intuitive feel 
for the material, it is important to recognize that an intuitive 
understanding must be informed and validated by research results.  
Ever since its founding, the findings of Experimental Psychology have 
taught us not to trust unsupported personal hunches and intuitions 
about the reasons for human behavior.  There are a variety of ways 
in which ordinary day-to-day intuitions about behavior, both our 
own and that of others, can lead one astray (some are illustrated in 
the tutorial).  Most of the demonstrations used in this tutorial are 
designed to replicate phenomena which have been studied or 
validated under controlled laboratory conditions.  In fact, several of 
the demonstrations are drawn directly from research studies, 
although some procedural license is taken for purposes of 
demonstration.<p>

<h3>MEMORY</h3><p>
In one model of memory, short-term memory (STM) is described 
[e.g., 6] as having a limited storage capacity (seven plus or minus two 
chunks) for a relatively brief duration (estimates range from 12 to 
30 seconds without rehearsal).  Information can be maintained in 
STM for longer periods of time with maintenance rehearsal (MR), 
although this simple repetition of material does not appear to be 
very efficient at transferring information into Long Term Memory 
(LTM).  Rather, elaborative rehearsal (ER) appears to be the most 
effective set of processes for the transfer of information into long-
term storage.  Although the information in STM is usually thought to 
be represented by one of a relatively limited number of codes, there 
are several reasons to believe that any organizational structure in 
LTM is accessible as a basis for forming the chunks that are held in 
STM.<p>

LTM has a large capacity for storage of information for long periods 
of time.  There is, however, no easy or obvious way to determine the 
limits of how much can be stored, or for how long it can be stored.  
Several types of information are represented in LTM, including such 
things as facts and events, motor and perceptual skills, knowledge of 
physical laws and systems of mathematics, a spatial model of the 
world around us, attitudes and beliefs about oneself and others, etc.  
This information is more or less well organized in a variety of ways 
and varies in its accessibility as a function of several factors.  The 
factors determining accessibility of the information in LTM include 
such things as the conditions which existed at the time the 
information was stored, the recency of its last use, its degree of 
inter-relationship with other knowledge, its degree of uniqueness 
relative to other information, etc.  Most discussions of failure to recall 
information from LTM focus on explanations such as interference, the 
absence or inappropriateness of retrieval cues, or some type of 
organic dysfunction such as brain damage.<p>

An alternative model of human memory holds that there is no need 
to postulate a STM.  Rather, there is a working memory which is part 
of the larger memory system and not a separate memory.  Different 
degrees of persistence of information in memory are thought to be a 
function of the elaborateness or the depth to which information has 
been processed.  The greater the degree of processing, the longer the 
retention period.  In this model, chunks are organizational units in 
LTM and the capacity limitation is on how much information can be 
actively scanned or held in working memory at any given time.<p>

While the bulk of the evidence supports the model which includes 
working memory [1], there are basic phenomena with which any 
theory of memory must deal.  For example, regardless of whether 
one thinks of the seven plus or minus two capacity limitation as the 
result of a limited capacity memory or as a result of a limit on the 
amount of information which can be activated and maintained in an 
active state in working memory at any given time, it is clear that 
there is a capacity limitation.  Similarly, regardless of whether one 
thinks that memory rehearsal processes have different degrees of 
depth and elaboration or that there are two different kinds of 
rehearsal processes, each associated with a different memory store, it 
is clear that elaborative rehearsal is more effective than maintenance 
rehearsal in insuring that the information will be accessible in 
memory for a long period of time.<p>

<h3>PROBLEM SOLVING</h3><p>
A major turning point in the literature on problem solving occurred 
with the work of Newell and Simon [4].  In their view, a problem can 
be analyzed by means of a &quot;problem space&quot; representing 
various states of knowledge of the problem solver, a series of 
transformations between states, and a set of operators which 
produce those transformations.  A problem exists when we have a 
gap between an initial state and a goal state.  The means of solving 
the problem involves applying the appropriate set of operators 
required to complete a series of state transformations that will 
eliminate the gap.  These transformations must be accomplished 
without violating any of the conditions on the operators.<p>

As a result of repeated experience with problems, solvers build up 
an organized body of knowledge or information about the properties 
of a particular type of problem and the operations or steps required 
to solve it.  This organized body of information is usually referred to 
as a problem solving schema [e.g., 5].  Humans develop a wide 
variety of familiar problem schemas [3], and the typical individual 
has built up a wide stock of such schemas which come into play in 
solving problems problems with which one has prior experience.  
Some schemas are so familiar they are activated almost 
automatically and without much thought.<p>

Typically, the effect of problem solving schemas is to help provide 
reasonably efficient methods of solving frequently encountered 
kinds of problems.  Sometimes, however, a schema can interfere with 
the problem solving process.  Since it influences the problem solver's 
early analysis of the problem and determines which schema, or 
schemas, will be brought to bear in solving a particular problem, the 
way in which that problem is represented can make a vital 
difference in how easily the problem can be solved.  When a problem 
is not solved as easily as expected. it is often quite fruitful to look to 
the adequacy of the representation of the problem, and to give 
thought to changing that representation.<p>

<h3>SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION 
DESIGN</h3><p>
In considering the nature of human memory it is clear that designers 
need to take account of the fact that there are a limited number of 
&quot;chunks&quot; of information with which a user can actively 
cope at any given time.  While the size of those chunks can be 
affected by assisting the user in the development of additional new 
knowledge structures, that growth of knowledge requires that the 
user be actively engaged in elaborating and assimilating that 
knowledge.  In addition the demands upon human learning and 
memory can be reduced by providing appropriate mnemonic cues in 
the interface.  However, those cues should be part of the context in 
which the user learns about the system.  In considering the nature of 
human problem solving it is clear that designers need to take account 
of the fact that users will bring to bear established problem solving 
strategies which are developed from having solved problems which 
have been frequently encountered in the past.  While these 
established strategies can be used to facilitate usage they can also 
create process blockages which may only be solved by changing the 
way in which the problems of interaction are presented to the 
user.<p>

Among the more general implications of the phenomena described 
above for human-computer interaction design there are two which 
stand out.  The first of these, derived from consideration of the 
nature of long term memory and the processes governing storage 
and retrieval of information, is that humans interacting with 
computers can and do use existing memories and memory structures 
to assign a meaning or interpretation to a wide variety of things, 
regardless of whether that meaning was intended by the designers.  
The second major implication, derived from consideration of the 
nature of the way people solve problems is that, people, &quot;...do 
not do what designers want them to do; instead they tend to get 
actively involved and to think and plan and solve problems 
[2].&quot;<p>
