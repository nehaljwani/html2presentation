<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>
<BR>
The need for effective information retrieval systems becomes increasingly important as computer-based 
information repositories grow larger and more diverse.  In this tutorial, we present the key issues involved 
in the use and design of effective interfaces to information retrieval systems.  The process of satisfying 
information needs is analyzed as a problem solving activity in which users learn and refine their needs as 
they interact with a repository.  Current systems are analyzed in terms of key interface and interaction 
techniques such as querying, browsing, and relevance feedback.  We discuss the impact of information 
seeking strategies on the search process and what is needed to more effectively support the search process.  
Retrieval system evaluation techniques is discussed in terms of its implications for users.  We close by 
outlining some user-centered design strategies for retrieval systems.

<H2>INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AS A PROBLEM SOLVING PROCESS</H2>
<BR>
The field of information retrieval can be divided along the lines of its system-based and user-based 
concerns.  While the system-based view is concerned with efficient search techniques to match query and 
document representations, the user-based view must account for the cognitive state of the searcher and the 
problem solving context.  People are drawn to an information retrieval system because they perceive that 
they lack some knowledge to solve a problem or perform a task.  This creates an &quot;anomalous state of 
knowledge&quot;[1] or &quot;situation of irresolution&quot; [6] in which information seekers must find 
something they know little or nothing about.  
<P>
Information retrieval systems must not only provide efficient retrieval, but must also support the user in 
describing a problem that s/he does not understand well.  The process is not only one of providing a good 
query language, but also one of 
supporting an iterative dialogue model.  As users query and browse the repository, they learn more about 
the problem and potential solutions and therefore refine their conceptualization of the problem.  The 
information being sought differs from that being sought at the beginning of the session.  The user is 
engaged in a problem solving session in which the problem to be solved, that of finding relevant 
information, evolves and is refined through the process of seeing the results of intermediate queries.
<P>
<H2>THE VOCABULARY PROBLEM</H2>
<BR>
Even in cases where the information is well-known, a vocabulary problem still exists.  Users may know 
what they are looking for, but lack the knowledge needed to articulate the problem in terms and abstractions 
used by the retrieval system.  An inherent problem is that people use a surprisingly diverse set of terms to 
refer to the same object, such that the probability for choosing the same term for a familiar object is less than 
15 percent [3].  This problem is exacerbated by the fact that information repositories are often indexed by 
experts and by the inherent properties of the objects.  Expert indexing causes problems because less 
knowledgeable users, who define the majority of people experiencing anomalous states of knowledge, are 
less likely to understand the terminology used by experts.  Indexing by inherent properties causes problems 
because most information seeking is engaged in some problem solving context.  People are looking for 
information that is <I>used </I>for something and are therefor more concerned with how an object is used, 
not its inherent properties [4].
<P>
<H2>INTERFACES FOR RETRIEVAL SYSTEMS</H2>
<BR>
Current information retrieval systems have addressed these inherent properties of information seeking and 
indexing in a variety of ways.  Browsing has been employed to facilitate the iterative and ill-defined nature 
of information seeking, but can lead to a loss of direction and overly narrow searches.  Queries provide a 
means to direct the search, but often rely on the user understanding a complex query language and proper 
vocabulary to be effective.  An integration of these strategies is a promising approach that can solve some of 
these problems [5].  Information visualization techniques such as the Perspective Wall at Xerox PARC [2] 
can be used in interface design to improve both browsing and querying.
<P>
Good information retrieval system design combines a combination of support for information seeking 
strategies, such as browsing and direct querying, in an interface that provides effective cues to the location, 
use, and characteristics of the retrieved information.  Feedback techniques are also crucial to support the 
iterative refinement of information needs.
<P>
<H2>EVALUATION TECHNIQUES</H2>
<BR>
Traditional retrieval system evaluation relies on the measures of <I>recall </I>(the proportion of relevant 
items in the entire repository which have been retrieved) and <I>precision </I>(the proportion of retrieved 
items which are relevant) for assessment of system effectiveness.  There are significant problems with these 
measures of effectiveness, and the criterion on which they are based, <I>relevance</I>. These include such 
issues as:
<ul>  
<li>who makes the relevance judgments, and how are these judgments related to the user's context 
and the use of the items; 
<li>lack of knowledge of the total number of relevant items in the repository for any 
given information problem; 
<li>how to evaluate these measures over the course of an interaction; and, 
<li>the 
validity of the measures themselves as indicators of the effectiveness of the information interaction.  
</ul>
This suggests the need for new measures of retrieval effectiveness in interactive retrieval systems. 
<P>
Furthermore, new evaluation techniques are needed that account not only for the accuracy of a retrieval 
system, but also its interactive abilities and ease of use.  A system that measures poorly in recall and 
precision, but provides good browsing and iterative querying facilities may be more successful overall in 
responding to a person's information problem than a system which is &quot;more effective&quot; in terms 
of recall and precision 
<P>
<H2>DESIGN STRATEGIES</H2>
<BR>
Guidelines for the design of information retrieval systems must address not only issues of look-and-feel, 
but also of effective interaction.  Dialog models based on relevance feedback and query reformulation 
explicitly address the ill-defined nature of information seeking by allowing users to learn from the 
repository and iteratively refine the information need.  Systems need to support a number of interaction 
styles, such as querying and browsing, to accommodate the different kinds of search strategies users may 
need to use.
<P>
Design strategies for retrieval systems need to pay particular attention to the interaction between users and 
the texts they retrieve.  People's information seeking behavior needs to be analyzed in the problem solving 
context in which their information needs arise.  For example, what are some of the common associations 
people make?  What information is closely related?  What different perspectives can a piece of information 
be viewed from?  The answers to these questions often differ, depending critically on the nature of the task 
and the individuals performing the task.  Task analysis, user modeling and interaction modeling are some of 
the strategies that can be used to improve the design of retrieval systems.
