<H2>ABSTRACT </H2>

<P>
Technology to support groups is rapidly coming into use and is
starting to have an impact on us, our organizations, and society.
This course addresses recent experiences, current possibilities,
and future trends and shocks. Lecture and video illustrations
are accompanied by discussions in which participants organize
and present their collective experiences with and interests in
groupware and workflow technologies, and CSCW issues and methods.
The instructors summarize the current composition of the CSCW
community and the state of the art in technology, and organize
discussion of fundamental challenges that face us as users (and
developers) of these technologies.

<H2>CSCW, GROUPWARE &amp; WORKFLOW: DRAWING ON EXPERIENCE </H2>

<P>
Five years ago most experience in computer-supported cooperative
work was confined to research laboratories. The situation has
changed. Although relying primarily on lecture and video illustrations,
this tutorial provides a framework for attendees who have some
experience as designers, developers, evaluators, marketers, buyers,
and users of these technologies, to share and build on their diverse
experiences. We identify the most important challenges and what
has been responsible for successes and failures that have been
experienced. The participants and organizers will discuss and
present their experiences with different types of groupware. No
one person has had all of these experiences, but collectively
the tutorial participants provide a qualified, thoughtful group
of discussants. Past tutorials benefited from the observations
and insights of tutorial participants.
<H2>A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY CAST OF THOUSANDS </H2>

<P>
Most CHI Conference-goers have a general awareness of CSCW research
and groupware technology, but it is easy to lose track of how
varied the people working on these topics are. By reviewing their
backgrounds as technologists, behavioral and social scientists,
customers, and users (who themselves come from a wide range of
organizational contexts), we can see the opportunities to learn
from people whose expertise or experience complements our own.
We will outline the major contributors to CSCW and groupware:
researchers from diverse fields, developers working in varied
contexts, users in different cultures...
<H2>THE STATE OF THE ART </H2>

<P>
Our survey of the state of the art serves two purposes: It provides
information about research and development activity to tutorial
participants whose experience or expertise is likely to be focused
in one or two areas, and the framework for presenting the technologies
serves to focus subgroup discussions of experiences with the technologies.
We identify three categories of groupware: communication, cooperation,
and coordination.
<H3>Communication Support </H3>

<P>
Five trends have guided the evolution of communication groupware.
(1) Capabilities for communication are improving within a given
medium. (2) Multiple media are being integrated within single
communication systems. (3) The interfaces to communication tools
are strongly influenced by metaphors, and these metaphors are
often the basis of social control. (4) Structure is added to communication
media to support performing tasks. (5) Standards are emerging
and solidifying to support both platform and application interoperability.
<P>
Electronic mail, desktop conferencing, and video conferencing
are changing both personal and business communications. Businesses
use email to accelerate the flow of information and reduce coordination
costs [7]. Video conferencing is used for group communication
within geographically distributed companies and between corporate
partners. Desktop conferencing focuses communication on work products.
Each type of communication groupware offers unique advantages,
and new technologies can achieve all the advantages by integrating
email and conferencing features.
<H3>Cooperation Support </H3>

<P>
Groupware supports cooperation by enabling interaction through
a shared document or collection of documents. For example, document
management systems help teams collaborate by providing access
and version control, document search, and status tracking. Application
development environments such as Oval and Lotus Notes customize
the structure and functionality of the system to the task. These
environments integrate both communication and workflow features
on a core of cooperation support [5].
<P>
Meeting support products and prototypes enable all participants
to collaborate in the production of a shared document or documents.
The strength of these systems is generation of alternatives [6].
In a brainstorming session all users can enter as many ideas as
they want anonymously. A recent study of the benefits of a meeting
system found that it saved 91% of the work flow time over 64 meetings.
<H3>Workflow: Support for Coordination </H3>

<P>
Businesses are attempting to increase quality and reduce cost
by modeling and improving their internal processes. Coordination
groupware can capture and coordinate these processes. Work flow
management systems model the sequence of subtasks in a work process
and the roles performed by each individual. When each subtask
is completed, the work is automatically routed to the person responsible
for the next subtask.
<P>
Coordination groupware can also support group work that does not
conform to a formal process. Ad hoc coordination is supported
by groupware that accommodates the informal rules of communication
that occur in the workplace. The theoretical foundation for these
technologies is Speech Act Theory [1].
<H2>CHALLENGES IN DESIGN AND EVALUATION </H2>

<P>
Successfully overcoming technical hurdles has not guaranteed success.
In this section of the tutorial we briefly review behavioral,
social, and organizational phenomena that have been observed to
undermine technically impressive applications. Some of these obstruct
the development of useful and usable software, some hinder the
acquisition of the systems, and many get in the way of successful
use. Throughout the tutorial, participants will be invited to
identify those challenges that they have encountered or anticipate
as they set about acquiring, using, or developing groupware.
<H2>OVERCOMING THE CHALLENGES </H2>

<P>
The literature includes case studies of successful use of groupware
technologies, including some recently conducted by the organizers.
Tutorial participants will contribute others. In this section,
we will briefly review several promising, novel approaches to
the successful design and introduction of groupware that are being
explored.
<H2>GROUPWARE AND THE FUTURE </H2>

<P>
Although we can point to trends and possibilities, we cannot predict
which groupware or workflow products will emerge, which will succeed,
or which will fail. Nevertheless, at a broader level, we can identify
changes that are likely to raise fundamental questions for us
as users as well as developers of these technologies. Members
of society, informed or otherwise, will have to resolve how these
technologies are used. We will conclude the tutorial by identifying
a few global developments and invite the participants to identify
others. One is the tension between liberating and constraining
effects that often accompany technologies, including groupware.
Another, perhaps the most fundamental, is the increased visibility
of activity in the global village and our reaction to seeing much
of that activity for the first time.
