<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>
<P>The object of this panel is to identify criteria for effective 
groupware. That is, criteria that can be applied either to guide 
design or to help a purchaser select from alternative groupware 
applications. The criteria are expected to be generally applicable 
and so we take a broad definition of groupware. Panellists have 
been chosen with expertise in low bandwidth groupware such as 
email and PDAs as well as higher profile multi-media applications.
<P><H2>KEYWORDS:</H2> Groupware CSCW, evaluation, design.
<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>Designing and evaluating systems for one person interacting 
with one computer is still a significant challenge. Designing and 
evaluating groupware systems is exponentially more difficult. As 
well as having to consider human-computer interactions, one has 
also to consider, human-human interactions, computer-computer 
interactions, and human-another-computer interactions. In 
addition, the tasks to be supported by a groupware application are 
likely to be quite different to those supported by a single user 
application. There must be support for individual work as well as 
group efforts. 

<P>
<P>The panel is to identify criteria that can be applied either to 
guide design or to help a purchaser select from alternative 
groupware applications. Some criteria arise because of demands 
on the individual. The need for ease of use and low cognitive effort 
in human-computer interaction may be particularly important in a 
groupware application where the user's primary task is 
communication. Others arise because of demands on the group. A 
commonly identified problem with software is that members of a 
group may not be aware what the other members are doing. 
Finally, some criteria arise because of demands on the 
organisation, e.g., the requirement for critical mass.

<H2>BILL BUXTON</H2>
<P>Criterion: Operational transparency
<P>Exemplar: Meeting rooms, the Ontario Telepresence Project
<P>Bill is Principal Scientist at Alias | Wavefront, director of the 
Telepresence Project, and a professor of Computer Science at the 
University of Toronto.
<P>It sounds banal to state that the interactions in group activity 
are complex, but when it comes to supporting such interactions via 
technology, it seems that even the banal, or seemingly obvious, 
needs to be made explicit. Perhaps this is because, despite the 
complexity, we are so skilled in the task, that we take it for 
granted, or forget how long it took us to learn. A bit like tying up 
one's shoelace, or riding a bicycle. Note, however, that all of the 
preceding has to do with the "how" or operational aspects of group 
dynamics, not the content. And it is just as well that we are skilled 
in these tasks, or else there would be serious task interference 
between the "how" and the "what" aspects of interaction. 
<P>All of this leads to the point that when group interactions are 
mediated by technology, the risk of interference rises dramatically. 
And the simple point that follows, then, is that the objective of 
good design is to make the intrusive aspects of the technology 
disappear as quickly as possible. In this presentation, we will 
discuss how this can be achieved, using examples from the Ontario 
Telepresence Project. What will unfold is a story of adaptive 
environments, that have knowledge about domain specific 
activities, and which are tailored to fit the existing (social) skills of 
the group - skills already acquired from a lifetime of living in the 
everyday world.
<P><H2>DAVID FROHLICH</H2>
<P>Criterion: Personal benefit
<P>Exemplar: Communicating personal digital assistants (PDAs)
<P>David is a member of the User Studies Group at Hewlett 
Packard Laboratories in Bristol.
<P>Some time ago I learned of an interesting comparison between 
two  groupware systems designed to collect healthcare statistics 
from  mobile community care professionals.  The first system, 
called  COMCARE, ran on a handheld computer and required 
workers to input  patient and visit statistics primarily for 
management audit. This took considerable time and effort and 
workers were very bad at keeping their statistics up-to-date.  The 
second system, called COSS, ran on a laptop computer and 
required workers to input the same statistics. However this time, 
the statistics could be used by workers themselves through an 
additional patient care planning system. Consequently workers 
were better at maintaining up-to-date records, which management 
could then use to improve the funding and coordination of group 
work. Thus the  second system was altogether more successful 
because it provided a personal as well as a group benefit to 
workers. 
<P>Taking forward this simple lesson I argue that personal benefit 
is a powerful criterion for effective groupware, and particularly 
appropriate to the design of lightweight tools for remote 
collaboration. Using data from a video-based study of mobile 
professional work I show that much personal work is itself 
interpersonal in nature. This means that substantial personal 
benefits can be provided through support for communication as 
well as for personal information management; as shown by the 
rise of the communicating PDA as the ultimate 'personal system'. I 
also point to the need for effective groupware to deliver mutual 
personal benefit across the workgroup so that some members do 
not use the technology to exploit the goodwill of others to their 
own benefit. Taken to its conclusion, this argument suggests a new 
paradigm for groupware in which group benefits are specified as 
emergent properties of tools supporting individual collaborative 
work. 
<P><H2>SARA BLY</H2>
<P>Criterion: Adaptability
<P>Exemplar: The PARC Media Space
<P>Sara is an independent consultant in the areas of user 
interfaces for individuals and distributed groups. 
<P>Adaptability is a critical criterion in determining the potential 
success of a groupware application. Applications that allow users 
to adapt the technologies to their own needs and uses allow social 
behaviours to rule interactions as appropriate and provide the 
opportunity for codevelopment of the technology and the work 
activity. In particular, it means not building a set of procedures 
and structures into the technology that dictate group behaviour. 
At one point in the history of the Xerox PARC Media Space, 
monitors were configured so that one could not see the display 
screen without also being on camera. While this offered a good 
basis for ensuring reciprocity in viewing, it also constrained the 
camera position. The technology had taken on the responsibility 
for enforcing the rule that "If you can see me then I can see you". In 
fact, the group had used the technology in many interesting and 
useful ways precluded by such a ruling. Participants moved 
cameras to bring attention to something they wanted to share (a 
view outside of a pretty day, a whiteboard illustration of a 
discussion underway); participants glanced at monitors from a 
variety of positions to stay aware of remote sites; participants 
situated cameras for interesting office overviews. 
<P>To meet the adaptability criterion, we must allow users as 
much control over the technology as possible. This is not to say 
that applications should leave all decisions to users but rather to 
provide configurations that can easily be changed. For example, 
privacy is certainly an important issue in groupware applications. 
Looking at it from the adaptability point-of-view suggests that the 
technologies support the users in establishing their own modes of 
behaviour. Most of us would find it silly to enforce locked doors in 
all workplaces despite the fact that an open office offers the 
possibility of intrusion. Groupware applications should offer tools 
rather than rules.
<P><H2>STEVE WHITTAKER</H2>
<P>Criteria: (i) Critical mass and (ii) Awareness. 
<P>Exemplar: Lotus Notes
<P>Steve is a Research Scientist at Lotus Development 
Corporation. 
<P>Critical mass means having enough users of the 
product/prototype, furthermore these must be people the user 
wants to talk to, and collaborate with. The importance of critical 
mass can be illustrated by a number of examples of both 
asynchronous and synchronous groupware: a Lotus Notes 
discussion database can fail as a forum for exchanging ideas 
because there is an insufficiently large number of contributors so 
that discussions and topics rapidly become stale. Research 
prototypes we have built have also suffered from lack of critical 
mass: there is little benefit to having desktop videoconferencing, or 
lightweight electronic paging technology if your recipient lacks the 
hardware and software to communicate using these. This makes it 
difficult to test the utility of these more advanced features and 
systems. The solution is not a technical one: it requires corporate 
selling of the product individual sales are unlikely to be successful 
until there is a large enough user pool. 
<P>Awareness is being informed about when others are active, or 
when critical events occur in a shared application. For 
asynchronous shared applications such as Notes, users need to be 
notified of such changes without necessarily having to open the 
application and inspect its contents for changes. Again Notes 
discussion databases have been unsuccessful because users are 
uncertain when and whether their contributions have been seen 
and responded to by others. Users may contribute to a discussion, 
but in the absence of notification it may be some time before others 
become aware of the change. Furthermore, the absence of 
notification means that such databases cannot be used for urgent 
or time critical interactions. Solutions discussed include polling 
and specialised server processes.
<P><H2>AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION</H2>
<P>We are keen to elicit criteria from the audience as well as the 
panellists. Forms will be distributed at the beginning of the panel. 
These use the following headings. 
<P>A. Name and affiliation
<P>B. Possible name for criterion.
<P>C. Illustration of the problems that arise if this criterion is not 
met. (This is best presented as a story including a brief statement 
of the context.)
<P>D. Examples of the kinds of inventions, features or strategies 
that can meet this criterion.
<P>E. To what categories of group does this criterion apply?
<P>F. To what categories of application does this criterion apply?
<P>Clearly, much of the information entered under these headings 
will be necessarily "sketchy". In the session the audience and 
panellists will fill out the missing details. Please try to confine the 
criteria to things that apply to particularly to groupware rather 
than HCI in general. Contributions given to the organisers in 
advance will be most welcome.
