<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<p>
Despite high profile discussions of user-centered design in the CHI
community, until recently a substantial population of users has been
largely ignored. Users who have restricted or no use of hands, eyes,
ears, or voice due to environment, task context, repetitive strain
injury, or disability constitute a diverse and significant user
population, but these users receive relatively little mention in
mainstream HCI conferences or literature. Design considerations for
users with vision, hearing, or movement impairments overlap with those
for the general population across a variety of tasks and contexts (e.g.,
high workload tasks, automobile systems, phone interfaces). Following on
this theme, the panel will promote discussion of so-called &quot;Universal
Design&quot; -- design for the broadest possible range of users.

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<P>Our panelists agree on the importance of Universal Design, but have
different perspectives on what it means, to what extent it can be
achieved, and the HCI, technical, and social barriers to doing so. Each
panelist will provide a brief statement of their perspective. Panelists
will discuss short-term and long-term solutions to questions and
scenarios drawn from real life describing users with restricted input or
output capabilities. Questions discussed may include:
<P>
<LI>How can people without disabilities benefit from technologies for accessible computer systems?
<LI>What is the greatest barrier to increasing accessibility? 
<LI>Have software vendors and developers done enough to provide accessible systems?
<LI>How can user interface designers make a difference?
<LI>Is it possible to provide solutions for users with disabilities without causing problems for everyone else?
<P>The focus will be on users with disabilities, but with an eye towards
applicability to the general user population. The panelists provide four
distinct perspectives: a technology policy expert, an access technology
manager from a major operating system/application vendor, an access
technology developer, and a university based HCI researcher. At the
close of discussion, the moderator will suggest simple low-cost actions
that attendees can take to improve accessibility of their designs today,
and the discussant will focus on implications for HCI as a whole.
<P>Few members of the CHI community have had exposure to issues
surrounding users with disabilities.   We expect that this panel will
increase awareness of how Universal Design can benefit both people with
disabilities and any user whose task or environment dictates alternative
interaction styles.

<h2>PANELIST POSITIONS </h2>
<P>
<h3>Alistair Edwards </h3>
<P>It was once pointed out to me that it is the decisions that designers
make when they are not thinking about people with disabilities which
have the greatest affect on their lives. Another way of looking at that
is to say that if designers had slightly greater awareness of the
breadth of abilities of potential users then very little extra effort
would be necessary to make universal access a reality.  Addressing
difficult questions gives us an opportunity to generate novel answers.
For the most part the technology is available. There is no reason why we
should remain tied to the keyboard, mouse and screen. True multi-
modality can make an interface more usable for the majority of users -
and can make the difference between being usable and totally
inaccessible for others.  
<P> The motivation also now exists to put these ideas into practice. In the
United States laws are forcing manufacturers to address the needs of the
whole broad range of users, so that it has become a commercial
imperative. In Europe legislation varies from country to country but
overall is not as effective as in the US.  However, the European
Commission is keen to develop assistive technology and is encouraging
this through its TIDE initiative.
<P><I>Alistair Edwards </I>is a lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at
the University of York, and a member of the HCI Research Group. His
principal interest is the use of multiple interaction modalities to make
computers accessible to people with disabilities. He is editor of the
recent book, Extra-Ordinary Human-Computer Interaction.
</P>

<h3>Deborah Kaplan </h3>
<P>Progress towards universal design can be achieved in the short run by
(1) changing the underlying assumptions about universal design.
Universal design strategies can be a creative shortcut to creating
fundamentally more useful interfaces, rather than merely a nice thing to
do for disabled people. And, (2) universal design can best be
implemented by using the design process to catch problems that result in
less useful applications.
<P>In the longer run, expert systems that can assist in the implementation
of universal design could be extremely useful, with multimedia used to
provide a closer look at good examples of universal design. Such systems
could take an engineer or product designer through a process that would
begin by taking into account usability requirements for people with
permanent or temporary functional limitations. The result would be new
and better technology innovations for all. Pending legislation will
require regulations to be developed regarding access to information
technology for disabled people. The challenge will be to develop
regulations that allow creative solutions based on industry/consumer
consensus.
<P><I>Deborah Kaplan </I>is Vice-President of the World Institute on Disability. She is also the
Director of the Division on Technology Policy, for which she oversees
policy projects that bring together leaders of national disability
groups with representatives of the telecommunications industry to
educate each other and find common goals.

<h3>Greg Lowney </h3>
<P>Computer systems have traditionally been developed without thought about
their impact or benefit for people with disabilities. Business was
uninterested due to low demand from the mainstream market (including
employers), low visibility of the disability community as a market, and
lack of formalized knowledge of the principles and benefits of
accessible software design. The issue has gained prominence and we have
published guidelines, but adoption is still slow because of demanding
project schedules, and because the standardization called for often
conflicts with the company's need to innovate in their user interface
and in developing more efficient, customized implementations.
<P>To address these needs, Microsoft has undertaken educational initiatives
to raise awareness of accessibility issues and promote accessible design
principles, and also technical initiatives designed to free software
from the implementation constraints required for accessibility today.
Microsoft is also trying to set a positive example for the industry as
the first software company to adopt a corporate policy on accessibility,
and by strengthening ties with the disability community.
<P>However, to truly motivate commercial organizations we must continually
demonstrate the benefits accessible design provides to all users through
improved ease of use, support for future user interfaces such as hands-
free and eyes-free operation, and improved automation and application
integration.
<P><I>Greg Lowney </I>is a senior program manager responsible for coordinating
activity at Microsoft related to making computer systems, products, and
services accessible. Mr. Lowney founded and has managed Microsoft's
Accessibility and Disabilities group since 1992.

<P>
<h3>T.V. Raman </h3>
<P>A truly well-designed UI is one that the user does not notice. However,
today's computer interfaces have become so complex that they often
overshadow the computing task that they were supposed to enable. Alan
Perlis once said &quot;One man's constant is another man's variable.&quot;
Today's computer interfaces reflect the truth of this statement in no
uncertain measure when one tries to provide alternative access paths to
standard computing tasks.
<P>To date, attempts at providing alternative speech access have
concentrated on retrofitting speech interfaces onto a visual UI that was
designed with no thought to alternative modalities. The inadequacy of
these screen-access interfaces points to the need for separating the UI
from the underlying compute engine and treating speech as a first-class
medium in the interface.
<P>Adobe Systems is committed to ensuring that our key applications such
as Acrobat are equally accessible to all users. Mainstreaming of speech
technology offers HCI researchers a unique opportunity to rethink
application design. Adaptive technology offers researchers the
opportunity to be on the cutting edge of this field. The benefits of
separating the UI from the underlying compute engine will be first felt
in the field of adaptive technology.
<P>But in the long-term, the benefits of adaptive technology are far
greater to the general user. History has proven this over and over again
--- how many of us remember that the invention of the telephone was a
by-product of attempts to invent a hearing aid?
<P><I>T. V. Raman </I>works at Adobe Systems. His interests include
richly encoded electronic documents and speech interfaces. You can read
about his work and use interactive demonstrations of some of the systems
he has built at the URL: http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/raman.
