<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>
Exploring or browsing is a process of searching in which the user recognizes the object of the
search when they see it   a human-driven and unstructured process. To examine this process, three
navigational aids are experimentally manipulated: method of access, method of suggesting items
to explore and method of navigation. A fourth aid, cues that influence exploration, are also
assessed. The object of the study is to characterize browsing, to understand what facilitates
browsing in an electronic environment, and to suggest an abstract representation of browsing.

<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
In the past decade, searching for information in electronic systems has changed from an
intermediary, third-party operation to one that is user-driven. This shift from a traditional to a
contemporary system is reflected as well in a change in the type of data   from bibliographic
citations to full-text. Of interest to this study is the evolution in method. Users now identify the
object of a search by <I>recognition</I>   by navigating from screen to screen until they find what
they need in a process of browsing or exploring [1,2,3]. Traditionally, users (via an intermediary)
specified the object of the search in advance by entering a set of keywords in a process of
querying. In fact, searching by recognition and searchingby specification are integrated in current
systems; users employ one method or the other while seeking information. This study will
concentrate on the less-researched, less understood and much-maligned browse method that
emphasizes exploration. <P>

The process of browsing is as much human-driven as it is machine-driven. Users are guided by the
system. Because they receive instantaneous results, they cognitively encode the new information
and use it as a lever in further searching, i.e., information begets information [4]. These systems
are primarily, although not exclusively, textual, and thus this search method is influenced by
centuries of reader-text interaction [5]. Guthrie's 5-component model of information search best
illustrates this process from both a procedural and cognitive viewpoint [6]. <P>  Designing
effective systems to accommodate browsing is difficult. Browsing success depends on the ability
of a user to navigate the system (unlike querying which depends on sophisticated search
algorithms). Hypertext has been widely used. Despite the extensive treatment of navigational
problems [7], like orientation and digression, hypertext is only a partial solution. Numerous
features, such as maps of hypertext links, electronic bookmarks and  footprints,' have been added
to overcome problems. As a result, systems often suffer from an excess of 'featuritis'. The most
significant problem, however, is our lack of understanding of what users do when they explore,
what influences how they browse, and what might facilitate that process. <P>  In this study, I
argue that information representation and type of navigational aid influences users' success in
browsing. Because users rely on recognition to determine the search outcome, they need
suggestions of what to explore. These suggestions may be similar or dissimilar to the information
currently being examined.  Simultaneously, users need to retain a sense of their spatial location
within the system. To accommodate both requires a dynamic unconstraining device that facilitates
exploration and a stable anchoring device that functions to orientate. An analogy to real world
travel is the stabilizing influence of mileage signs with the diversion provided by signs signifying
roadside attractions. The stabilizing signs serve as landmarks, provide route direction and
hopefully over time lead to the acquisition of survey information [8].  Both can be formed by a
representation of the information. A user's exploration at the local level, i.e., within a node of
information, may  be implemented by sequential paging, but the exploration is directed by cues
from the content landmarks. <P>
An electronic newspaper will be the vehicle used to examine browsing in this study. Research on
electronic newspapers has focused on the personalized newspaper --  the daily me -- based on user
profiles [9]. Thus, of secondary interest will be an assessment of browsing behaviour exhibited by
readers of electronic newspapers. Characteristically, newspapers contain heterogeneous,
free-form, and voluminous amounts of information unlike the vehicle used in many studies.Three
types of navigational aids will be experimentally manipulated: 1) method of suggesting other items
to browse based on a cosine similarity measure: one system-specified and one controlled by the
user; 2) method of presenting stable orienting devices: a collapsible / expandable hierarchical
menu and a filtering fish-eye view of the menu; and 3) method of navigating: use of sequential
paging and use of hypertext links. In this 2x2x2 factorial design, menu presentation and method of
navigating will be between-subject variables while method of suggesting items to browse will be a
within-subject variable. A fourth aid, content cues that influence navigation at a local level, will
not be manipulated but will be investigated. Additionally, the study will evaluate the applicability
of an amplified version of Guthrie's information search model to browsing. <P>The purpose of
this study is to: 1) characterize browsing in an electronic environment; 2) assess the impact of
three navigational aids on browsing; and 3) study these variables in the context of an information
search model.
<P>
<H2>METHODOLOGY</H2>
Sixty-four community college students will browse, search and read both current and back issues
of an electronic newspaper four times over a period of four weeks. The database will contain the
previous twelve months of the paper (negotiations are currently underway with a Canadian
newspaper publisher). During the study, the database will be updated as issues are released so that
subjects are examining the current issue of the paper. The database will start with about 250 mb
of information and will increase by 20 to 30 mb during the course of the experiment, a potential
confound that will be assessed. Four different interfaces (one for each experimental group) will be
used for the study and each will vary according to the three types of navigational aids discussed
above: 1) menu presentation styles, 2) method of listing items to browse, and 3) method of
navigating. Additionally, three non-modal windows will be used so that both dynamic and stable
navigational aids are always visible. The third will contain the test of the articles. <P>    Subjects
will do two types of tasks: browse the newspaper as is their usual practice and answer specific
questions. These types of tasks will be devised based on search goals: implicit and explicit. While
explicit goals are typical of many information system studies, implicit goals are unconscious goals
that lie dormant in long-term memory or arise from a user's exposure to the information.<P>
Data will be collected using two types of transaction log files. One will contain keystroke/mouse
imprints while the second will contain a video' of the session, much like the results from Lotus
ScreenCam. Users will walk through a 're-play' of the video, indicating user goals, identifying cues
that influence navigation and evaluating information received. <P>  Several types of analyses will
be done including: 1) a multivariate analysis of variance of both subjective and objective
performance measures such as informativeness [10] of the session, extent of exploration, and
accuracy of the task; and 2) a path analysis to validate a model of browsing.  <P>
<H2>CONCLUSIONS</H2>
This study will reveal how users browse in large information systems: what patterns of behavior
are exhibited, how performance varies across the two distinctive tasks and how different
navigational aids influence patterns of use. This study is especially pertinent today. Searching
through the digital haystack is becoming a daily ritual as information is increasingly being
delivered in digital form to homes, schools and business. Browsing is without a doubt the key
form of novice interaction with those systems. Hence improving our understanding of how users
interact is an imperative as we become a self-service information society. <P>
