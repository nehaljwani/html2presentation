<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>
<P>
The goal of this research is to quantify the effects of a
head-mounted display's field of view (FOV) on human performance
of 3D tasks representative of those typically performed in virtual
environments.
<P>
<b>Keywords</b>
<P>
Head-mounted display, field of view,
task performance, adaptation, spatial awareness, presence, simulator sickness.
<P>
<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>
<P>
Head-mounted displays are tools that allow us to perform tasks in 3D
virtual environments, borrowing from our natural abilities to perform
3D tasks in the real world.
An important parameter in choosing or designing an HMD is the field
of view (FOV) of the display.
<P>
In the real world, our effective FOV spans
approximately 200 degrees horizontally by 150 degrees vertically.
Many commercially available HMD's have relatively
narrow fields of view, ranging from roughly 30 to 70 degrees diagonally.
<P>
Narrow FOV has been shown (in real environments) to degrade human performance
on navigation,
manipulation, spatial awareness, and visual search tasks, and to
disrupt our eye- and head-movement coordination and our perception of
size and space
[1][2].
<P>
Wide FOV displays are not yet generally available,
and even when the engineering difficulties of realizing them are
overcome, choosing the widest FOV possible may not
be optimal for many applications.  A wide FOV will
aggravate simulator sickness effects, and in particular those due to
vection and visual-vestibular mismatch
[4]
[9], and wide FOV may be unnecessary for tasks
that are localized within a small spatial region of interest.
<P>
<H2>RESEARCH QUESTIONS</H2>
<P>
This research will address the following research questions through
controlled user studies on a set of tasks that is representative of many
of those typically performed in virtual environments applications.
<P>
<UL><LI> <em> Task Performance:</em> What is the performance for a given field
of view as measured by errors made and time required to complete the
task, for a set of representative tasks?
<LI> <em> Adaptation:</em> To what extent can users adapt to a given FOV in
order to perform to a required specification?
How long does this adaptation take, and how long does re-adaptation to
the real world take?
<LI><em> Search and behavior strategies:</em> How is eye-head movement
coordination affected by FOV?
<LI><em> Augmenting the field of view:</em>
Is it possible to present additional peripheral information in a
narrow physical field of view using distortion, and
how much compression is tolerable before artifacts occur causing users
to misjudge object locations?
</UL>
<P>
The remainder of this document discusses the four classes of tasks
that are being studied under different FOV conditions.
This is followed by a discussion of simulator sickness factors
related to FOV.
<P>
<H2>Navigation</H2>
<P>
Peripheral vision is known to be well-suited to maintaining self-orientation
during locomotion[5],
and there is evidence to suggest that a narrow
field of view detracts from a person's ability to navigate
through an environment effectively.
Alfano and Michel [1] measured the ability of subjects
to walk along a path while wearing goggles to restrict their FOV and
found that a FOV of 12 or 40 degrees resulted in a significant errors
and less pronounced effects were still present with a FOV of 90 degrees.
<P>
The present research will include studies to
measure a subject's ability to walk through a complex
virtual environment while avoiding collisions with obstacles.
The task will be duplicated in a ``real world'' condition, in which the
subjects will wear a mock HMD having weight, center of gravity, and FOV
equivalent to one of the real HMD viewing conditions.
<P>
The hypothesis is that a larger FOV will cause fewer object collisions
because subjects will be able to see more of the environment and also
because more peripheral vision will give them a better sense of their
movement and of their own position and orientation in the environment.
<P>
<H2>Reaching and grasping</H2>
<P>
Tasks involving manual manipulation using one or both hands
may be considered as having two phases:
reaching (rapidly moving the hand to the vicinity of a target for
manipulation) and grasping (using the fingers and thumb to have
an effect on the object).
There is evidence to show that
grasping ability is not significantly affected by FOV,
but that reaching ability is degraded by narrow FOV.
This manifests itself in misjudged distances to objects
[7].
<P>
A reaching task will be tested under different FOV conditions.
The hypothesis for this task is that response time will vary with
the distance to the target and that response time will likely have
two components: the time to locate the object visually (by moving
the head) and the time to reach for the object.
Another hypothesis is that subjects may misjudge the position of the
targets in a direction to or from their own position
depending on FOV,
and that subjects' consistency in judging distances may
vary with FOV.
<P>
<H2>Cognitive mapping and spatial memory</H2>
<P>
For virtual environment applications such as architectural walkthrough,
it is vital that the participant obtain an accurate spatial layout and size
of objects in a scene.
Researchers have reported that a narrow FOV tends to make
objects appear nearer than they really are and to effectively shrink
the environment around the user
[1][2].
<P>
In the present work, this will be tested in conjunction with the
navigation study.  After subjects perform a navigation task, they will be
removed from the virtual environment and given a spatial memory task.
They will be asked to report the presence or
absence of various objects that were in the environment and the spatial
arrangement of the objects.
<P>
The hypothesis is that with narrow fields of view subjects may miss some
of the objects or misjudge their position within the environment, and may
underestimate the size of the environment as a whole.
<P>
<H2>Visual search</H2>
<P>
To some extent, most everything to be done in a virtual environment involves
visual search.  To navigate we need to find the place we wish to
move to; to reach for something we usually need to locate it visually;
to ``take in'' an environment and form a mental model of it we need to
scan it visually.
Visual search is a task that has been widely studied [8].
Peripheral vision is important for searching because, while we
do not use the periphery to recognize and identify objects, visual
events in the periphery serve to trigger changes in gaze
[5].
<P>
A study is being conducted to measure the effect of FOV on a search
task that involves finding and identifying randomly placed targets.
This task will measure search time as a function of FOV and measure
the magnitude and frequency of head movements as a function of FOV.
<P>
<H2>Vection and simulator sickness</H2>
<P>
Wide FOV has been shown to cause increased simulator sickness
effects due to vection [9].
Vection refers to the illusion of self-motion
(we perceive ourselves to be moving when our body is not), and it has
been cited as a key indicator of simulator sickness
[4]
[6].
<P>
To assess the effect of FOV on simulator sickness, the
present studies will include the administration of a standard
simulator sickness questionnaire [3].
