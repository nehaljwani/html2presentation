<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>
There are an increasing number of methods for using context in design. Unfortunately these methods are strong on the 
collection of contextual data but weak on ways to use the data in design. Furthermore, current methods suffer from bias which 
constrains the type of data collected by designers as well as the ways the data can be put to use. However, rather than 
eliminate these biases, we propose that designers should exploit them. This paper argues that this can be achieved by 
facilitating the creation of explicit links between the human context and the design specification and that this requires 
computer based support. Without such links, the use of context will be unsystematic and, potentially, ineffective.<P>
<h3>Keywords</h3>
Context, design notations, development tools, design rationale, activity theory.<P>
<H2>SUMMARY</H2>
HCI approaches to design have distinguished themselves by their focus on user tasks, user needs and preferences, the social, 
environmental and even technological aspects of users work. The human context in which a system will be used has been 
stressed as an important resource to use and one which must be used by designers if a successful system is to be developed. 
The result of this is that there now exist a wide variety of techniques for involving users in design such as participative design 
[7], activity theory [1] and Contextual Inquiry [6]. Unfortunately, while the methods are strong on the collection of contextual 
data, they are weak on ways in which to use the data. For example, Contextual Inquiry describes many useful techniques for 
eliciting data from users but lets designers down when it comes to using the data, suggesting for example that affinity 
diagrams can be drawn to identify problems and concerns in users' work.<P>

Furthermore, each method suffers from bias in the type of data collected and the ways in which it uses data. For example, 
Bødkers application of activity theory to interface design [1] encourages designers to focus on learning, leading them to 
concentrate on the dialog design. Domain analysis [4] on the other hand encourages designers to concentrate on the objects 
that a system should implement and the functionalities required by those objects (see [2] for a discussion of contextual 
biases).<P>
In general then, these methods do little to bridge the large gap between analysis and design, leaving designers with much work 
to use contextual data fully and effectively. In order to narrow this gap, we need not only to collect relevant contextual 
information, but also to knowingly make the best use of it. The different biases of each approach should be exploited rather 
than eliminated. For example, at a particular stage in a project, a domain analysis approach may be taken, defining the 
functionality of the system. Later, an activity theory approach could help design the dialogue. Lastly, if use of contextual 
information goes unrecorded, this will raise serious implications during development and maintenance (eg inconsistency, 
inappropriate modifications) as well as unnecessarily wasting much of the contextual enquiry itself.<P>
To achieve these aims of making full and effective use of relevant contextual information, we believe that a computer based 
tool is essential. The tool will allow relevant human context to be structured in such a way that explicit links can be created 
between it and various design notations. These links will allow assessments to be made of how fully and effectively the 
human context has been used in the design. The full effects of changes in the context and the design can be highlighted. Thus, 
consistency throughout the design, operation and maintenance phases of a project can be ensured. A computer based tool will 
be necessary due to the high number of links that will likely be produced by designers using the tool and the difficulties in 
traversing these links.<P>
The rest of this paper describes a case study that was carried out as part of an investigation into contextual design and the type 
of links that would be required to allow full and effective use of contextual information to be made. It was also an opportunity 
to study requirements for the computer based tool. Lastly, conclusions and further work are presented.<P>
<H2>A CASE STUDY</H2>
The Computing Science department at the University of Glasgow administers the MSc in Information Technology course, a 
multi-strand course that provides a major proportion of several University planning units’' income. Applications are received 
from prospective students throughout the year and the process by which these applications are handled is time consuming and 
at times complex. Due to the amount of income that the course generates it is essential that applications are handled 
efficiently. The process of handling applications from when an applicant makes first contact with the University to the start 
of the course was studied. The aims of the study were to investigate how contextual information is used in design and to 
explore requirements for the computer based tool.<P>
Relevant stakeholders were identified and then asked questions about their experiences. Those that work with the system were 
interviewed about their work in their offices, while the applicants were sent questionnaires. The data obtained from the 
analyses was then modelled using scenarios and the various models described in [5]. Problems with the current system were 
then identified and a rough, high level design to address these problems, was produced. The design identified further areas of 
relevant context which required investigation. These further analyses were used to provide the missing details in the design 
with more contextual analysis being performed as and when required. This iterative process resulted in a fairly well specified 
design being produced which was then implemented.<P>
<H2>CONCLUSIONS</H2>
The study was used to expose an initial set of requirements for a computer based tool to support contextual development. It 
also highlighted a number of interesting issues two of which are described below.<P>
Originally it was anticipated that links would be one way, from context to the design. Instead, many more types of links are 
required. As mentioned, some design choices made some parts of the context relevant where previously they had been 
irrelevant. Only by choosing a certain design feature did some parts of the context become relevant. Therefore the design itself 
drove some contextual analysis.<P>
Links between the different models of context and design specifications were identified as potentially useful, so that 
evolutions of both could be recorded. As analysis proceeds, models change and it could be interesting to record key instances 
of each model. Recording the history of the design lets designers look back at it and learn from mistakes. Knowing a design's 
history will let designers understand what should happen to the design in the future.<P>
<H2>A COMPUTER BASED CONTEXTUAL DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT TOOL</H2>
A set of initial requirements for a computer based tool were exposed by the case study. These requirements have guided the 
initial design of the tool. Several different models are required to structure all the collected data. Thus the tool should support 
several modelling techniques. Also, several design notations need to be supported (the use of three is supported in [3]). 
Furthermore, many different types of links are possible, hence the tool should let designers create links between any parts of 
the design and any parts of the context as they see fit. More general requirements identified the types of information that 
designers would need, such as the number and types of links between particular aspects of the design or context.<P>
<H2>FUTURE WORK</H2>
Work on building the tool in Smalltalk and VisualWorks has begun. At present only one contextual modelling technique and 
three design notations are supported. Further models will be added to the tool. Once the tool is at a fairly advanced stage, a 
few small case studies will be completed using it. A design project will be 'shadowed' independently. The tool will be used 
independently of the project to see what difference the tool can make. For example, changes to the design or the context may 
have been better managed using the tool. The tool could help designers to make better use of contextual information, 
resulting in a system that better fits its context.<P>
