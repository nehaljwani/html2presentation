<H3>ABSTRACT</H3>

Informal communication and awareness of coworkers is an important
factor in the effectiveness of work in office environments. This
dissertation focuses on an architecture for the creation of prototype
tools which allow distributed workgroups to collaborate more
effectively by communicating informally. This architecture supports
the investigation of the area of informal communication and awareness
by allowing researchers to quickly develop new application prototypes
from reusable components.

<H3>MOTIVATION</H3>

Many people have observed that a good portion of the work that takes
place in an office environment is based on informal
communication. This type of communication ranges from conversations
around water coolers or coffee machines to simply noticing the people
one walks past during the course of a day. In many cases it is this
low-effort, informal communication which allows people to stay aware
of the activities of their colleagues and coworkers and provides the
&quot; context &quot; for work-related activities. Informal
communication and the resulting awareness of coworkers and their
activities is the central theme of my work. <P>

Recently, the research community has begun investigating the problems
of how to provide technological support for informal communication and
awareness. Systems such as the PARC Media Space [1] and CaveCat [2]
provide their users with a virtual &quot; space &quot; in which they
can conduct their activities. In these systems the virtual space
consists of an audio/video network which allows the participants to
see and hear each other. This network allows many of the informal
communication processes that occur normally in physical space to be
moved into virtual space. This breakdown of the barriers of physical
space is important because the communication process does not require
the participants to be co-located, they may be distributed in physical
space. <P>

Let us consider an example problem in the area of awareness across physical space. Alice is an administrative assistant for Betty, who telecommutes from her home. Alice needs to judge Betty's level of &quot; busyness &quot; to determine whether or not to forward incoming phone calls to Betty. For a tool to help Alice solve her problem of assessing whether or not to allow callers access to Betty it must meet the following requirements: <P>
<UL>
<LI> Alice must have some information about the level of activity in Betty's (home) work area.

<LI> Betty must be able to control Alice's (and others) access to her personal information.
</UL>

The first of these properties Betty would receive in a normal office
environment simply by being physically near Alice's office. The second
of these properties is analogous to Alice's ability to close her
office's door. <P>

One can imagine a software tool that allows Alice to perform this
task. Such a tool would give her some type of display on her computer-
perhaps a graph of some sort- of the amount of activity in Betty's
office. The &quot; activity &quot; could be measured by tracking mouse
movements, counting keyboard clicks, by taking digital video images
and processing them or combinations of these or other techniques. Such
a tool might also provide some type of &quot; ambient &quot; audio
information to Alice [3] to help keep her aware of the level of
activity in Betty's home-office. This software must also provide Betty
with an interface to allow her to control how and when Alice (or
others) may access the information the tool is gathering and, thus,
insure Betty's privacy when she desires it [4]. <P>

The example just presented is a specific problem for Alice and Betty;
I feel that there are many problems which are caused by geographic
separation and the inability to informally communicate which can
remedied with software tools like the one outlined above. As another
example of this type of problem, consider the informal information
which allows people to decide when to make a transition into a more
formal mode of communication. This type of transition can be difficult
to make when participants are not physically co-located. A tool which
solved this problem would allow users to have enough information to
determine when it would be appropriate to initiate a two-way video
conference, for example. <P>

<H3>TOOLKITS FOR AWARENESS</H3>

As discussed above, there are many types of inter-personal
communication problems which could use awareness information as part
of their solution. I am currently working on identifying the
commonality between these types of problems. Identifying this
commonality will allow the implementation of reusable software
components which embody the necessary computation so tools which solve
the communication problem can be easily constructed. A further
research contribution of this work is the construction of a framework
which allows these reusable components to be &quot; plugged together
&quot; in interesting and new ways. By virtue of allowing the rapid
development of applications in this area, this toolkit will allow HCI
and CSCW researchers to easily experiment with new ideas and paradigms
for supporting informal communication and awareness. <P>

There are several significant technical challenges that must be
addressed. First and foremost is the question of what reusable
components, which in this framework are called operators, should a
toolkit present so that an application writer or HCI researcher can
quickly develop their ideas into a testable prototype? Second, over
what domain should these operators function? For example, in the
example with Alice above, the tool she used might operate over the
domains of keyboard entry, mouse activity, and digital video. Finally,
what tools should be built in an effort to allow the application
writer or HCI researcher to interact with the toolkit and framework in
a natural way and minimize (or eliminate) the amount of code that must
be written to achieve their goals? <P>

Let us revisit the example of Betty and Alice again, now considering
it through the lens of the three questions just mentioned. First, I
have already established some of the domains of interest here:
computer input devices and digital video. For this toolkit to succeed
it clearly must present some reasonable interface to these types of
media, not to mention other related media such as the state digital
audio inputs and other sensors. Further, all of these domains reside
on the input side of the application: gathering the information. The
toolkit must also address output domains such as digital audio,
digital video, and the graphical user interface so the user can see
the results of the computations. <P>

In the previous example, the activity tool measures several quantities
such as the amount of keyboard and mouse activity and the amount of
change in a video scene. Abstractions must be present to compute all
of these values; and these will be the operators for this tool. An
operator which will be necessary in this example, but which is not as
obvious as the others, is some type of security operator which
operates over any domain. This operator should allow Betty to control
when and by whom her information can be accessed. Finally, to be able
to construct such an application for Alice a tool will be needed which
will allow the application developer to easily &quot; fit together
&quot; these operators and their domains into a result which Alice can
use effectively. <P>

This framework is based on the idea of connecting a source domain to a
sink domain. This connection is accomplished by connecting operators
that perform the desired computations. (This type of notation itself
is not new and has been used successfully elsewhere.) Figure 1 is a
simplified diagrammatic representation of the parts of my architecture
working together to create a visualization like the one Alice uses to
stay aware of Betty's activities. The two domains of the keyboard
(input) and the Graphical User Interface (output) are represented by
triangles and the operators are represented by the squared off
ovals. The black rectangles on the sides of the operators and the GUI
domain indicate that these objects can accept an input. The arrows
represent the flow of data from one part of the architecture to
another. <P>

As mentioned before, one of the goals of this work is to allow
application builders and researchers to build prototype applications
quickly using this architecture. Therefore, I am developing a tool
that will allow users to construct prototypes in a visual
representation similar to the one used above in Figure 1. It seems
reasonable that within the scope of informal communication and
awareness a tool could be built which would allow new and interesting
applications to be built without requiring the implementation of a
general tool for constructing arbitrary programs. Other disciplines
have had success with tools which allow for the visual construction of
programs in a domain, such as Iris Explorer and DEC's AVS in the area
of Scientific Visualization. <P>

In conclusion, the ability of coworkers to communicate informally and
stay aware of each others activities is important to the success of
their work. When coworkers are separated by space, their
communications break down due to the inaccesability of informal
information. This work is exploring the commonalities between the
problems that result from this spatial separation. These commonalities
are being used to develop an architecture and toolkit for the
construction of applications which solve the communication problems. <P>
