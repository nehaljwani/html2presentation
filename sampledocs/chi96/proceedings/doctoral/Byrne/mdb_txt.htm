<H2>Abstract</H2>
<P>One of the key factors in understanding what interfaces will be easy to use
is the limited capacity of the human information-processing system. This
work outlines a theory of human working memory which is instantiated as a
computational system called SPAN. Working memory and the related construct
of short-term memory have a long history in psychology, and in the last
decade have been used to explain differences in performance on a wide
variety of tasks both at the individual level and between different age
groups. The production system SPAN was constructed as an attempt to address
working memory issues based on several well-established mechanisms such as
decay, interference, and processing speed. One property unique to SPAN is
its ability to model the use of external memory. It is this last property,
combined with SPAN's explicit acknowledgment of individual differences,
which gives it a great deal of promise in applications to HCI
domains--particularly in the prediction of errors.</P>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>The basic idea of humans as limited-capacity information processors goes
back at least as far as the 1950's [7] and has gradually evolved into the
construct we now know as &quot;working memory.&quot; Particularly in the
last decade, working memory has received a great deal of attention from
researchers interested in different aspects of human cognition. One of the
central findings in the cognitive aging literature is that working memory
capacity generally declines with age in adults. Differences in working
memory capacity have been used to explain individual differences in young
populations and group differences between young and older adults in a
tremendous range of tasks, including natural language use (i.e.
comprehension, production, discourse recall, etc.), a wide variety of
reasoning tasks, recognition of declarative memory, procedural errors,
skill acquisition, and so on. This phenomenon is so pervasive that some
researchers have claimed that working memory capacity is the primary source
of individual differences in cognitive abilities outside of domain-specific
knowledge differences [6]. It seems clear  that working memory also plays a
critical role in understanding the interaction of humans with other
information systems, especially in understanding the errors that users make
[e.g. 2].</P>


<H2>Mechanisms of Working Memory</H2>
<P>Given that working memory plays a key role in our ability to predict human
performance, what do we know about how the human working memory system
actually works? It turns out that several important mechanisms have been
identified, such as: <EM>Decay</EM>. Items in working memory decay over
time. That is, the longer it has been since an item was needed in working
memory, the less likely it is that it is currently available [1].
<EM>Displacement/interference</EM>. As new items enter into working memory,
there are at least two repercussions in the rest of the system: other items
tend to become harder to access and the cognitive system becomes less
efficient, effectively slowing down [3]. <EM>Basic processing speed</EM>.
Partially as a result of attempting to determine what causes the
age-related decline in working memory capacity, researchers have discovered
that there is a strong link between simple processing speed and working
memory capacity [9].</P>

<P>Despite the centrality of working memory as a psychological construct and
the amount we know about how it works, there is at present no
formal/computational theory which integrates these mechanisms into a
coherent whole and can be used to predict user performance. Providing such
a theory is the central aim of this research.</P>


<H2>A Computational System for Working Memory: SPAN</H2>

<P>SPAN (which stands for Speed, Parallelism, Activation, and eNvironment)
is a production system designed to computationally realized the mechanisms
described in the previous section. It has declarative elements or chunks
which have activations that decay over. In addition, an element's
activation must be above a threshold level for the element to be matchable
by productions. Productions (IF-THEN rules) have the primary function of
propagating activation, and are limited by two factors: a global speed
parameter (used to realize individual differences) and total system noise,
which is a complex function of the activations of the individual elements.
This yields a system with a functional limit to its processing bandwidth as
a function of processing speed. </P>

<P>There is another aspect of the theory which is clearly relevant to HCI:
external memory. Since memory elements in SPAN are fragile, the functional
capacity of the system can be augmented by the use of memory elements that
do not decay or contribute noise: those in the environment of the system.
For example, it is impossible for most people to multiply two ten-digit
numbers without the use of some kind of external memory store, such as a
piece of paper. SPAN provides a way to formally model this important aspect
of human memory use.</P>


<H2>SPAN and Human-Computer Interaction</H2>
<P>Though at this point, SPAN is primarily an exercise  in theoretical
cognitive psychology, the potential for application to issues in
human-computer interaction (HCI) is great. GOMS models have proved
themselves useful in understanding certain aspects of  HCI, and it has been
shown that the process of transforming a GOMS&nbsp;model into a set of
productions is fairly straightforward [4]. However, SPAN provides
advantages that GOMS and other production systems lack. The key advantage
is that SPAN can predict working memory failures and therefore certain
classes of user error. Other advantages include the ability to make
predictions about individual differences in performance, as well as taking
into account the impact of what information is and is not available to the
human operator in the form of external memory. All of these are important
aspects of the human-computer interface that are not handled particularly
well by GOMS&nbsp;analysis or other production systems such as Soar
[8].</P>

<P>Detailed modeling of the memory ramifications of a human-machine system
may be useful in the prediction of performance in terms of both fluency of
use and in the prediction of errors. SPAN models, augmented by appropriate
device or interface models, should be able to predict at what points the
information load in an interface may become problematic for particular
users. In addition, such models may be able to suggest to designers what
information ought to be available in the interface to help avoid the
errors. The inability of GOMS-based models to aid in the prediction of
errors has often been taken as a key weakness (or at least incompleteness)
in such models; SPAN offers a way to make model-based predictions about
errors.</P>


<H2>Current and Future Work</H2>
<P>Currently, I&nbsp;am attempting to use SPAN to model the results of
various psychological experiments in an attempt to test the particular
mechanisms chosen for SPAN. In the future, I would like to extend SPAN by
incorporating a more complete model of the perceptual-motor system such as
the one found in EPIC [5] and using SPAN to evaluate real-world interface
designs. I would also like to incorporate a learning mechanism into SPAN to
better understand the effects of practice on human cognitive
performance.</P>
