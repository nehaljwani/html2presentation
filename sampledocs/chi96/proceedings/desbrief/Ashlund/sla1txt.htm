<H3>ABSTRACT</H3> This is a case study about a commercial software design 
and development process.  The highly successful product contained some 
usability problems that were apparent from a usability perspective, but 
were to be delayed in the upcoming release.  A <A 
HREF="http://www.lotus.com/home/notes.htm">Lotus Notes</A> database was 
used to record usability issues, UI design recommendations, and decision 
rationale.  This database was the key strategy that helped convince the 
team to make changes.  The processes and UI design solutions described are 
not new; rather this design briefing focuses on how they were deployed to 
effect change that wouldn't have happened otherwise.  &quot;Before&quot; 
and &quot;After&quot; screen shots illustrate this success story.<p>

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3> When the first usability engineer joined Lotus 
cc:Mail in the fall of 1993, the popular award-winning LAN e-mail product 
had 6 million users.  At the time of this writing, two years later, the 
number is over 8 million.  <A 
HREF="http://www.lotus.com/ccmail/">cc:Mail</A> runs (or is being 
developed) on <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Windows</A>, <A 
HREF="http://www.austin.apple.com/macos/macosmain.html">Mac</A>, <A 
HREF="http://www.austin.ibm.com/pspinfo/warpflyer.html">OS/2 WPS</A>, <A 
HREF="http://www.austin.ibm.com/pspinfo/supplemt.html">DOS</A>, <A 
HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/open-look/top.html">Unix 
OPEN LOOK</A>, <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Windows 95</A>, 
and the <A 
HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/World_Wide_Web/">World 
Wide Web</A>.  With such a significant installed base and multiple 
platforms, any user interface change faces considerable coordination and 
discussion.<p>

<P>This design briefing describes the usability efforts on the immediate 
successor to <A HREF="http://www.lotus.com/ccmail/">Lotus cc:Mail</A> for 
Windows V2 that were directed towards improving its usability for 
end-users.</P>

<H4>The Usability and Design Team</H4>
The usability and UI design work described in this briefing was a 
collaborative effort among two usability engineers, one UI designer, and 
several developers, technical writers, and product managers.  Quality 
engineers and technical support also contributed to the process.<p>

<P>Until this point in time, cc:Mail had gathered considerable feedback from 
its customers, but mainly from two types of customers: high-level decision 
makers with purchasing authority for a corporate-wide e-mail system, and 
cc:Mail LAN administrators.  The usability group was formed to get in touch 
with the end-users, and to improve and evolve the product from this 
perspective.</P>

<H4>Phases of the Design Process</H4>
This design briefing summarizes four overlapping phases of the design 
process.  Note that this is how the process actually happened, not how it 
was originally intended.<p>

<P>The first phase is referred to as <A HREF="sla1ph1.htm">&quot;The Next 
Major Release&quot;</A> in this briefing.  Design and development was 
already in progress on this release by the time the usability lab was 
constructed in early 1994.  There was already a strong usability group at 
Lotus headquarters, but the effort was new to the cc:Mail division until 
this time.  The second phase, <A HREF="sla1ph2.htm">&quot;Usability 
Testing&quot;</A>, began in April, 1994.  The third phase, <A 
HREF="sla1ph3.htm">&quot;Usability Tracking&quot;</A>, began in the summer 
of 1994.  A fourth phase, referred to internally as <A 
HREF="sla1ph4.htm">&quot;The Food and Shelter Release&quot;</A>, began in 
the fall of 1994.  Iterative UI design work was taking place throughout all 
four of these overlapping phases, so is not explicitly called out.  Some 
&quot;Before&quot; and &quot;After&quot; screen shots are included to 
demonstrate the kinds of usability improvements made.</P>
