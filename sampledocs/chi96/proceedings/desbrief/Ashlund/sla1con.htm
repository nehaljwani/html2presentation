<H3>CONCLUSIONS</H3>
These examples may seem very minor, but they added up to a significant 
difference for the user.  The biggest reason for this success was that the 
usability team did not propose large-scale changes to the UI, only small 
changes, such things as rearranging icons and rewording dialog boxes.  In 
usability testing throughout the development cycle, users found that <A 
HREF="http://www.lotus.com/ccmail/">cc:Mail</A> behaved more like users 
expected it to than in the previous version.  In most cases, changes were 
so subtle that users didn't know what had changed, only that it had changed 
for the better.  They were now able to accomplish the basic tasks.<p>

<P>Creating the <A HREF="http://www.lotus.com/home/notes.htm">Notes</A> 
database for tracking usability issues was the single most important 
strategy used to convince the team to make changes and accomplish these 
measurable usability successes.  It provided a reliable source of 
quantitative results and was indispensable to this project.</P>

<P>The usability problems and processes described here are surely not novel 
to the <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/sigchi/chi96/">CHI</A> community.  And 
yet such apparent usability problems actually existed in a highly 
successful best-selling end-user product.  It was the judicious application 
of well-known UI design principles, combined with a software engineering 
tracking methodology, that finally got them fixed.</P>
