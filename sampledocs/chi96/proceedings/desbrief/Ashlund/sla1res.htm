<H3>THE RESULT:  GOOD NEWS FOR THE USER</H3>
Before long, the developers had implemented several of these usability 
fixes.  Usability testing was then conducted on the revised code.  This 
testing revealed some necessary refinements to areas that had changed.  By 
stressing the fact that these were refinements to existing problems, e.g., 
a change fixed a big problem but introduced several related smaller 
problems, not new problems, all but the most technically difficult problems 
were fixed.  Subsequent usability testing convinced the team that the right 
changes had been made successfully.<p>

<P>Little by little, of the 350 usability issues logged against cc:Mail for 
Windows, almost one-third of the total got fixed in the &quot;Food and 
Shelter&quot; release.  <STRONG>Table 1</STRONG> shows the numbers of 
usability issues that were deferred, and fixed, according to priority.  
These numbers show that the percentage of fixes increases as the priority 
increases, demonstrating that usability efforts were focused on improving 
the most important areas.</P>
