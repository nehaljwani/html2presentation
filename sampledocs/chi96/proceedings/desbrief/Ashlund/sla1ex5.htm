<H4>Example 5</H4>
<STRONG>Figure 11</STRONG> shows the top portion of a new message window in 
cc:Mail for Windows V2.  To address a new message, a name from the cc:Mail 
directory is typed on the text entry field to the right of the 
&quot;To&quot; combo box.  After typing the name, the user must press the 
Enter key to put the name into the blank list box below the field.  If 
Enter is not pressed, the name is visible, but the Send command is 
inactive.  The Send menu command is gray and the Send icon just beeps when 
clicked.  The user receives no useful feedback as to the cause of the 
problem or how to correct it.<p> <br>

<P>The problem of having two separate places for addresses (one to enter 
them and one to view them) couldn't be solved in the short term.  Instead, 
the problem was essentially solved with a simple workaround; the Send 
command was enabled regardless of whether a name was simply typed or typed 
and entered.  When a typed name is not entered and Send is chosen, a dialog 
box appears to prompt the user, e.g., &quot;A name has been typed in but 
not entered into the address list.  Do you want to send the message to this 
address?  Ashlund, Stacey&quot;.  By choosing the default button, Yes, the 
message can be sent.  User confirmation was required because of the 
critical nature of accidentally sending a message to an unintended 
recipient.</P>

<H4>Other Examples</H4>
Many of the other changes are not as visual.  In cc:Mail for Windows V2 all 
windows started by default as maximized.  This made it difficult for users 
to navigate within cc:Mail; they'd forget which message windows were open, 
and had difficulty getting back to windows hidden behind other maximized 
windows.  The redesign changed the default window size to nearly full-size, 
but leaving just enough room to see if there was another open window behind 
the current one.  If users could see it, they could click on it.  Another 
change was enabling the use of the Escape key to close windows, in addition 
to the difficult Windows standard Control-F4 or double-clicking the hidden 
control menu (the lower of the two rectangles in the upper left corner of 
<STRONG>Figure 11</STRONG>).  Lastly, many commands in V2 were modal, e.g., 
the user must first open and go to the Address Book Window before the 
Create Mailing List command is enabled.  The redesign allows the user to 
choose the command from any window, and if the necessary window is not yet 
open or visible, it is automatically displayed.<p>
