<H3>PHASE 1:  THE NEXT MAJOR RELEASE</H3>
By the time the usability lab and team were created, the decision had been 
made that the next release of <A HREF="http://www.lotus.com/ccmail/">Lotus 
cc:Mail</A> was to be a major release, not a point release.  The plan was 
to produce an entirely new and improved version of cc:Mail, including many 
new features.  From a usability perspective, the ideal goal for a product 
with such a significant installed base would have been to retain the good 
aspects of the UI and improve the bad.  Instead, the development plan was 
to throw it all out and start over fresh.  Since the underlying 
functionality was to be significantly different, this fact was to be 
reflected in a brand new cc:Mail UI.<p>

<P>A committee called UA/UI (User Agent/User Interface) was in existence at 
this point in the process.  The User Agent referred to the 
&quot;client&quot;, or the code that presented the UI of cc:Mail.  The 
members of the UA/UI committee included development representatives from 
the five cc:Mail platform teams ( <A 
HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Windows</A>, <A 
HREF="http://www.austin.apple.com/macos/macosmain.html">Mac</A>, <A 
HREF="http://www.austin.ibm.com/pspinfo/warpflyer.html">OS/2</A>, <A 
HREF="http://www.austin.ibm.com/pspinfo/supplemt.html">DOS</A>, and <A 
HREF="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/open-look/top.html">OPEN 
LOOK</A>), managers, technical writers, product management, and the one 
usability engineer.  Approximately nine people attended a typical UA/UI 
meeting.  One person was designated to take minutes, but no other roles 
were established.  For several weeks, the committee met eight hours a day, 
four or five days a week, gradually reducing to half- or full-day meetings 
once or twice a week.</P>

<P>The UA/UI committee was planning the next major release to be the first 
version to run on <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Windows 
95</A> (still called V4 or Chicago then).  This new environment meant 
designing for <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">SDI (Single 
Document Interface)</A>, instead of <A 
HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/kb/softlib/winsdk.htm">MDI (Multiple 
Document Interface)</A>.  It also meant a new focus on &quot;objects&quot; 
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/VISUALC/V4/V4Tech/REOLEC.HTM">(OLE2)</A>.  
Since the UA/UI meetings focused on these technologies, they were heavily 
system-centered, as opposed to task-oriented or user-centered.</P>

<P>A typical UA/UI discussion revolved around types of message lists and 
storage methods.  Whenever a visual or behavioral UI design issue was 
raised, it was postponed, as the developers could rarely agree on a 
cross-platform UI solution.  For example, if a graphical representation 
proposed for Windows did not have an obvious DOS alternative, or had a 
conflicting meaning in OS/2, the discussion was noted in the minutes and 
put on hold indefinitely.</P>

<P>UA/UI meeting minutes, mainly questions, open issues, and investigative 
action item assignments, were typed and distributed, read, revised, and 
redistributed.  Additional UI design and development discussions took place 
via e-mail and in hallway discussions.  The modal of the UA/UI meetings was 
clearly &quot;design by committee&quot;.  After a while, the usability 
engineer was asked to run these meetings.  Due to this intensive time 
commitment, usability testing was not yet taking place in the new lab.</P>
