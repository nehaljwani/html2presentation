<H4>Example 2</H4>
<STRONG>Figure 3</STRONG> shows the dialog box from cc:Mail for Windows V2 
that was displayed when a new message was started, and then the message 
window was closed.  The dialog box was displayed to confirm whether the 
user really wanted to close the window and lose anything entered in the 
message so far.  The problems with this dialog box may be obvious.  The 
phrasing of the question was confusing, as it was the reverse of the common 
confirmation found in other applications, &quot;Do you want to save your 
changes?  Yes or No&quot;.  Users expected that Yes would be the safe 
choice, and save their changes.  But in reality Yes &quot;canceled&quot; 
the changes, or discarded them.  In addition, there was no way to use this 
dialog box to save the changes at all.  The only &quot;choice&quot; the 
user was given was to lose the changes or not close the window.  Clicking 
No simply dismissed the dialog box and left the message window open.  
Usability testing revealed that this dialog box was difficult to use by 
novices as well as experts who had been using cc:Mail for years.<p> <br>

<P>The redesigned dialog box is shown in <STRONG>Figure 4.</STRONG> With 
this new dialog box, the message can be saved &quot;as is&quot; in the 
Drafts folder for later completion (a &quot;feature&quot; added as part of 
this usability fix).  The message can be sent if it is already addressed.  
Or the message can be closed and discarded.  Clicking OK is a 
&quot;safe&quot; choice by default.</P> <br>

<P>Similarly, if an existing message is modified (a message that the user has 
received, as opposed to a new message), and then closed, the dialog box 
shown in <STRONG>Figure 3</STRONG> was also displayed in V2.  The revised 
dialog box is shown in <STRONG>Figure 5.</STRONG> Again, this time the user 
was given useful choices, instead of just the ability to discard the 
changes.  The modified message can be converted into a reply or a forward, 
or discarded.</P>

<P>These changes did not require adding any new features to the 
application.  cc:Mail already contained the functionality to save a draft 
or allow the user to forward or reply to a message.  These features were 
just never before offered to the user upon closing a message window.  It 
had not been anticipated that users would use the action of closing a 
window as a &quot;fall back plan&quot; or shortcut for completing a 
message.  Note that the fact that a user can modify an existing message at 
all was not changed, as it was far to extensive and entrenched in the 
model.  Rather, very simple UI design and implementation provided the user 
with useful choices when and where they needed them.  Users tended not to 
recognize this as a change in usability testing, but were now able to 
answer their e-mail without having to think about what &quot;cancel 
changes&quot; would do.</P>
