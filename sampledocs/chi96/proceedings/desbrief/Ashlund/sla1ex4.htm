cc:Mail was originally intended for users on a LAN within a single company 
to send e-mail to each other.  This is very easy within cc:Mail.  When the 
first few characters of the name of someone within the same company are 
typed into the address of a new message, cc:Mail &quot;watches&quot; and 
displays a name that matches the characters typed so far.  Therefore, it is 
not straightforward to address to an external internet address.  Names or 
addresses that do not appear in the cc:Mail directory cannot simply be 
entered into the address field of a new message.<p> <br>

<P>To enter an internet address in cc:Mail V2, the user must first type the 
name of a gateway, such as <A 
HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/">&quot;Internet&quot;</A> 
or <A 
HREF="http://www.rutgers.edu/~sgro/HTML_Documents/WayoftheWeb/SMTP.html">&quot;SMTP&quot;</A> 
(determined by the cc:Mail administrator), and then enter the address in a 
&quot;Post Office Addressing&quot; dialog box, as shown in <STRONG>Figure 
9.</STRONG> Here, the user could enter any internet address, e.g., 
ashlund.chi@xerox.com, and optionally add it to the list so it could simply 
be selected for future use.  The same model applied for X400 addresses or 
sending a fax from cc:Mail.  Users had great difficulty with this dialog 
box; they didn't know what they could type in the field.  The revised 
dialog box is shown in <STRONG>Figure 10.</STRONG> Simple buttons were 
added to display optional secondary dialog boxes containing 
&quot;templates&quot; to fill in for each of the three types of address 
formats (e.g., Name @ Domain for addressing via an Internet gateway).  
Clicking the Internet button displays a dialog box containing two fields, 
labeled Name and Domain, separated by an @.</P> <br>
