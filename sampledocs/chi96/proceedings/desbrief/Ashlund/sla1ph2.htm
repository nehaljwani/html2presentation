<H3>PHASE 2: USABILITY TESTING</H3> While the work on <A 
HREF="sla1ph1.htm">the next major release</A> progressed from an 
architectural standpoint, the lengthy UA/UI discussions eventually faded 
out.  It became clear to the committee that it was too early to agree on UI 
designs.  The usability team grew to include two student interns and then 
began conducting testing.  Initial usability testing focused on the 
currently released versions of <A 
HREF="http://www.lotus.com/ccmail/">cc:Mail</A> for LAN and Mobile across 
platforms.<p>

<H4>User-Centered E-Mail Tasks</H4> Based on the first few rounds of user 
analysis and task analysis, the usability team created and refined the 
following &quot;Top 10 list&quot; of the most basic e-mail tasks:<p>

<OL>
<!- 1 ->
<LI><STRONG>Read.</STRONG> (Differentiate new mail from old; 
distinguish high priority messages from normal or low; identify the sender, 
other recipients, date and time sent, etc.)<p>
</LI>

<!- 2 ->
<LI><STRONG>Write &amp; Send.</STRONG> (Create a message; address it; 
write it; set priority; optionally save a copy; send it.)<p>
</LI>

<!- 3 ->
<LI><STRONG>Reply.</STRONG> (Reply to sender, some, or all recipients; keep none, 
some, or all file attachments.)<p>
</LI>

<!- 4 ->
<LI><STRONG>Forward.</STRONG> (Recognize a forwarded message; view 
forwarding information; forward one or more messages with or without 
forwarding information.)<p>
</LI>

<!- 5 ->
<LI><STRONG>Delete.</STRONG> (Delete one or more messages; put a message in 
the Trash or permanently delete it; know if Trash is enabled or how to 
enable it; set when to empty the Trash; retrieve a deleted message.)<p>
</LI>

<!- 6 ->
<LI><STRONG>Print.</STRONG> (Print one or more messages and any or all 
attachments, with or without the header; print a list of messages, e.g., 
just author, subject, and date.)<p>
</LI>

<!- 7 ->
<LI><STRONG>Attachments.</STRONG> (Read an attached file, view or launch 
it; attach one or more files; save attached files to disk.)<p>
</LI>

<!- 8 ->
<LI><STRONG>Folders.</STRONG> (Create a folder; store one or more messages 
in a folder; access messages in folders.)<p>
</LI>

<!- 9 ->
<LI><STRONG>Mailing Lists.</STRONG> (Create a mailing list; address a 
message to a mailing list.)<p>
</LI>

<!- 10 ->
<LI><STRONG>Search.</STRONG> (Find a message given the author, subject, 
date, word in the body of the message, etc.)<p>
</LI>
</OL> 

<P>This list does not include implicit navigational tasks, such as going back 
to an open message, getting back to the Inbox, reading next and previous 
messages, or closing a window.  It also does not include all the possible 
advanced tasks, such as finding copies of messages already sent, saving 
messages in progress, automating message storage by creating and running 
rules, etc.  This list stood the test of time.  The one thing everyone 
always agreed to is that these are the most commonly performed e-mail tasks 
and so should be the primary focus of UI design and usability efforts.  
This was an essential first step that helped the usability team eventually 
get buy-in on UI changes from the rest of the product team.</P>

<H4>Prototype Testing</H4>
In addition to testing released versions of cc:Mail, paper, <A 
HREF="http://198.105.232.6:80/vbasic/">Visual Basic</A>, and <A 
HREF="http://198.105.232.6:80/visualc/">Visual C++</A> prototypes were also 
tested.  These prototypes were primarily designed by development, with 
contributions from the usability team and the UI designer.  Prototype 
testing was valuable because it provided feedback on non-trivial UI 
variations without taking as much time as full implementation.<p>

<H4>Competitive Testing</H4>
The usability team also tested competitive products, such as <A 
HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/Mail/">Microsoft Mail</A>, according to the 
same user population and the basic tasks.  Developers often justified some 
of the known usability problems in cc:Mail for Windows by placing the blame 
on the environment, e.g., &quot;That's just the way <A 
HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft Windows</A> works.&quot; Testing 
competitive products afforded an opportunity to gather usability feedback 
on alternative design solutions without requiring any additional 
prototyping or implementation.  Competitive testing revealed design ideas 
of how to do things better as well as what not to do.  This testing proved 
to be a highly valuable source of motivation for change, particularly when 
a common feature was easier to use in another Windows product.<p>
