<H3>PHASE 3: USABILITY TRACKING IN NOTES</H3>
In addition to conducting testing, the usability team designed and 
developed a <A HREF="http://www.lotus.com/home/notes.htm">Lotus Notes</A> 
database.  The primary purpose of the database was to serve as a mechanism 
for tracking usability issues identified in testing.  Each issue was put 
into a separate Notes &quot;document&quot; which included a description of 
the problem, which platforms it applied to, and any cross-platform 
consistency issues.  Issues in cc:Mail on one platform frequently related 
to other platforms as well, as well as to issues in competitive products.  
To manage this information, Notes &quot;views&quot; were created for each 
product.  Then, the issues could be viewed by priority, functional 
category, or status.<p>

<P>Priority levels ranged from one to five and were assigned by the 
usability team based on frequency of the task and severity of the 
consequences.  The number of people who experienced a problem in a test was 
also a contributing factor.  For example, a problem experienced by eight of 
eight users in a test was assigned the highest priority.  Categories 
included areas of e-mail determined by development, such as addressing, 
folders, mailing lists, and search.  Issues could either be 
&quot;open&quot;, or assigned a status such as In Progress, Done, or 
Deferred, based on agreement between the usability team and development.  
This method was used for <A HREF="http://www.lotus.com/ccmail/">cc:Mail</A> 
on all platforms.</P>

<P>With the creation of the database, developers and product managers no 
longer had to make assumptions about addressing issues in the current 
product, for example, as they could simply &quot;query&quot; the database 
to see all addressing usability problems by priority or status.  The 
database provided an easy way to produce status reports for upper 
management, to assess the impact of a change in one area of the UI, and to 
compare against the usability of similar features in competitive 
products.</P>

<H4>Encouraging Team Participation in Testing</H4>
The <A HREF="http://www.lotus.com/home/notes.htm">Lotus Notes</A> database 
was also used to post reports and maintain the schedule of upcoming tests 
to encourage project team members (in all roles) to be involved.  Team 
members could contribute by observing tests and giving the usability team 
their impressions.  All teams within Lotus could access the database, but 
the views containing confidential customer information on test participants 
were restricted to the usability team only.  This was helpful in that it 
made usability efforts visible to a broad range of people working on the 
product.  In addition, it was part of the Lotus corporate culture to use 
Notes databases for project management, so it gave the usability group a 
tangible presence across the company.<p>
