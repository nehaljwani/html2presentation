<STRONG>Figure 6</STRONG> shows the dialog box from cc:Mail for Windows V2 
that was displayed when the user chose the Save command from the File menu.  
It could be used to save a message (and/or any or all of its file 
attachments) out to disk.  Users were confused by the term &quot;item&quot; 
(as the term &quot;attachment&quot; was much more common in the UI).  They 
also didn't like having to click OK before entering a file name, as they 
didn't know what the file would be called or where it would be saved by 
default.  They had to click OK and hope that cc:Mail would save the file 
with an obvious name, not knowing that they would ever be prompted to enter 
a file name.  When OK was clicked, the Save Options dialog box was 
dismissed and a secondary dialog box was displayed, allowing the user to 
then enter or change the file name and location.<p> <br>

<P>The revised Save As dialog box is shown in <STRONG>Figure 7.</STRONG> 
The default file location and name is displayed in a field and can be 
changed.  Alternatively, the Browse button displays an optional secondary 
dialog box as shown in <STRONG>Figure 8.</STRONG> In addition, the wording 
of the radio buttons was clarified regarding attachments and message text.  
The &quot;Text Options&quot; button only contained settings related to the 
message header, so is renamed and regrouped appropriately.  And finally, 
the Save Draft &quot;feature&quot; is made available here, where new users 
often expected to find it.</P> <br>
