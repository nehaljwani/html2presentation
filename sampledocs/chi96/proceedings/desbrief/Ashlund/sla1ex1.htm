<STRONG>Figure 1</STRONG> shows the top portion of the main cc:Mail window 
in V2.  It contains a title bar, menu bar, and SmartIcon bar above the 
Inbox (which displays the new messages).  The visible SmartIcons can be 
customized by the user, but by default are displayed as shown and listed in 
this picture.  It can be readily seen that some of the most basic tasks 
were not accessible from this default set of icons, such as Reply and Send, 
but many less-often needed icons were included, such as Rules, User Setup, 
and Empty Trash.  The revised SmartIcon bar is shown in <STRONG>Figure 
2.</STRONG><p>

<P>The number of icons was only increased by two.  Search was retained, but 
moved farther to the right, after the more common icons.  Help was moved 
near the end to increase its visibility.  Rules, User Setup, Rename, 
Cascade, Tile, Empty Trash, and Change Font were all removed from the 
default set.  Reply, Send, Attach, Read Previous and Next Message, Save As, 
Save Draft, and Close Window were all added.  The generic icon for Create 
was split up into two new icons to provide for its most often needed uses; 
Create Folder and Create Mailing List.  In V2 there was no icon for Close 
Window, so an icon was created for this purpose.  Prior to usability 
testing, it was not known that users had a difficult time with such a 
simple task as closing a window, as windows were maximized by default in 
cc:Mail V2.  Icons removed and added are listed in <I>italics</I> below the 
figures.</P>
