<H3>PHASE 4: A &quot;FOOD AND SHELTER&quot; RELEASE</H3>
The next significant turn of events occurred when the major release was 
intercepted by plans to do a much sooner release.  Work on the Next Major 
Release would continue, but a large portion of resources were temporarily 
rededicated to the urgent &quot;Food and Shelter&quot; release.  The 
remainder of this briefing will focus on this &quot;Food and Shelter&quot; 
release.  This release was to have back-end changes only, no UI changes and 
no new features.  It was nicknamed &quot;food and shelter&quot; to indicate 
that it would contain only the essential underlying changes needed to ship 
it as soon as possible.  Another popular phrase for referring to it 
internally was &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot;, to give the analogy that the 
very apparent, easy, quick things were to be fixed, and nothing else (just 
as ripe, low-hanging, fruit is easy to grab).  With this philosophy, the 
ever-growing number of usability issues in the database had little hope of 
getting reduced in the short term.<p>

<H4>Reconciling Usability vs.  Food and Shelter</H4> To respond to this 
change in schedule, the persistent usability team also adopted the 
&quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; attitude and compiled a short list of 
usability issues based on testing and submitted this to product management 
and development.  This list included only high priority issues that would 
be quick, easy, and low-risk to fix.  When an issue was extremely high 
priority, but very difficult to fix, the usability team documented the 
ideal solution in the database and proposed one or more possible compromise 
solutions to development.  If the list were too long, it was sure to be 
overwhelming and summarily rejected.<p>

<H4>UI Specification, Refinements, and Iteration</H4>
Fortunately for the usability team (and the end-user), product management 
was concerned with finding ways to keep customers satisfied with 
improvements to the product without causing further delays.  Some of the 
largest cc:Mail customer sites had voiced dissatisfaction about some of the 
same high priority usability problems observed in testing.  Product 
management requested that the usability team work with development to find 
solutions to these problems.<p>

<P>At this time, the UI designer was still assigned 100% to the ongoing 
work on the <A HREF="sla1ph1.htm">Next Major Release</A>.  She acted in a 
consulting role to the usability team and communicated usability results to 
the developers on the major release.  Due to the limited design resources, 
the usability team adopted multi-disciplinary responsibilities and began 
writing design specs for some of the highest priority issues in the 
usability database.  Design rationales were recorded in the Notes database 
to ensure against backtracking on an issue in subsequent design 
iterations.</P>

<P>Although everyone understood and agreed with the usability issues, 
development didn't know what to do about most of them without making major 
implementation changes.  As this was not possible, since all UI changes had 
been forbidden from this release, the usability team presented suggestions 
in a more manageable form.  Instead of large-scale, ideal solutions to the 
biggest problems, multiple partial solutions were presented to development.  
Development could then pick the solutions that were most feasible.</P>
