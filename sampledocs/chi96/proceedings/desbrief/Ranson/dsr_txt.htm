<H2><HR>Abstract</H2>
We explored how to bridge the gulf between physical and virtual environments
for the sport of whitewater paddling. Field observations, critical incident
analysis, exploratory prototyping, and field and lab evaluations were used
to make discoveries. Lessons learned in this ethnographic process led to
the design of a guiding, communication, and navigation aid for kayakers
and canoeists. In designing &quot;Rapid Scout&quot;, we gained insights
on making virtual representations context-sensitive, coupling multiple perspectives,
dealing with uncertainty, and extending human views. Ways to facilitate
collaboration through shared graphic frames of reference were also explored.

<H2><HR>Background</H2>
Our senses are exposed to an ocean of information in the physical world.
Computers allow us to add to what is naturally available. Yet a gulf often
exists between the physical world and the virtual worlds we create on computers.
Not only do we have trouble finding relevant information, but we often find
that virtual representations are disconnected from the &quot;real world&quot;
entities to which they refer. For instance, virtual representations may
fail to highlight changes, or their level of abstraction may be irrelevant
to user tasks. Given problems like these, better mappings between the virtual
and physical are needed. <BR>
<BR>
Bridging the gulf between the physical and the virtual requires discoveries
on several fronts. More knowledge is needed about coordinating multiple
virtual perspectives with existing physical views. Issues also arise in
putting data into context, choosing frames of reference, and indicating
limits [1]. Moreover, means to enhance cooperation between people must be
explored because virtual artifacts are inevitably used in group settings.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Natural Lab of Whitewater Paddling</B><BR>
We chose the whitewater domain to serve as our natural laboratory, because
it contains challenges and constraints relevant to coupling virtual and
physical worlds. Critical characteristics inherent in other complex domains
include a dynamic noisy environment, high stakes, uncertainty, multiple
players, as well as varying tempos and demands [2]. Due to the extreme nature
of this risky environment, these characteristics take on forms that create
significant challenges and opportunities. In particular, the complexity
of the hydrotopography of rapids offers fertile ground for representation
aiding. The dynamic flow, river bed shape, and obstacles combine to challenge
a paddler's judgment and maneuvering ability (see rapid in Figure 1). It
takes years to learn how to observe, abstract, and judge what the subtle
signs mean at different water levels (i.e., the process of &quot;reading
water&quot;). Paddlers rely heavily on scouting and communicating with others
to manage risk. Novices and experts alike actively seek and share information.

<P>What are the challenges that make bridging the gulf between the virtual
and the physical in this domain difficult? Of most importance, representations
must complement what paddlers see in the physical world. How did we achieve
this? We explored means to extend views by showing what is hidden, obscure,
or impossible to scout. We learned how to teach paddlers to read water by
highlighting the relationships which matter to them. We discovered new techniques
for showing contrasts and abstractions. And, we explored new ways to enhance
collaborative activity. The lessons learned from tackling challenges like
these can be generalized to other domains in which close virtual and physical
coupling is important. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Overview of the Design Process</B><BR>
Our design process can best be characterized by an analogy to the domain
we studied. Designing Rapid Scout was comparable to running a river with
many hazards, channels, tributaries, pushy currents, and possible routes.
We faced diverse obstacles that formed a constraint space in which we had
to maneuver. In the beginning of the ten-week project, we selected a user
group which we felt could benefit by a closer coupling of physical and virtual
environments. We then immersed ourselves in field investigations, where
we discovered that our initial model of activity in whitewater paddling
was incorrect and that there were significant opportunities for providing
guidance through an on-the-river device. Once the general Rapid Scout concept
was selected, we produced and evaluated in parallel exploratory prototypes
for the representation, communication, and hardware elements in order to
discover further requirements. <BR>
<BR>
A map of our design process is represented in Figure 2. There are three
main sections in our design process: (1) our initial model of the domain,
(2) field investigations to revise our model, and (3) continuous exploratory
prototyping and evaluation. The map summarizes our methods, findings, challenges,
and their implications for the design of Rapid Scout. <BR>

<H2><HR>Starting with a Naive Folk Model</H2>
All designers begin with an implicit or explicit model of cognitive activity
in a domain. Generally, this model should be viewed as tentative and should
be tested by ethnographic investigations. We discovered through field observation
that our initial model of whitewater paddling was incorrect. First, we considered
paddlers to be either in a thrill-seeking or a back-to-nature camp. We were
concerned that individuals intent on pushing their limits would not want
any decision aids. Likewise, we were concerned that the back-to-nature contingent
would be resistant to computer technology on the river. We also believed
that the sport was not team-oriented in that paddlers depended on their
individual skills and judgment. Lastly, we were concerned that the paddlers
would be preoccupied with the activity of paddling. The tempo would be too
high to permit any motor, perceptual, or cognitive interaction with a computer
aid. <BR>
<BR>
Through field research, we found that these assumptions were simply not
true. Paddlers tended to be cautious decision makers, information hungry,
and very reliant on others. Their desire for more accurate information due
to risks already led them share information using technology (e.g., the
World Wide Web). We also discovered that significant opportunities for interaction
with a device do arise. A paddler's hands, eyes, and mind are free at many
times (e.g., on flat water sections between rapids, scouting on shore, and
resting in the eddies/pools within the rapids). The distribution of these
locations still place severe constraints on when a paddler can use a portable
computer, but designing around these constraints offered new insights on
how to simplify interaction in virtual worlds. 
<H2><HR>Studying Cognition in the Wild</H2>
<B>Comparing Artifacts and Analyzing Tasks</B><BR>
We began our exploration by comparing existing domain artifacts to see how
they functioned as cognitive tools and supported collaboration. We looked
at formal media such as guidebooks and instructional videos as well as the
user-created forums on the World Wide Web. The lively web exchange of advice
and stories stressed that paddlers actively seek information. Advice tailored
to different river levels and complaints about guidebook inaccuracy stood
out. This finding pointed to the need for context-sensitivity. <BR>
<BR>
While examining these artifacts, we also developed a model of the tasks
involved. At the highest-level, running a river can be broken into five
stages: putting in, paddling flat water sections, scouting rapids, running
rapids, and taking out. The detailed cognitive models of these stages prepared
us for observing and asking questions. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Field Observation and Corpus Building</B><BR>
Our strategy was to ensure usefulness by grounding ourselves in the domain
and by not committing to one design direction too early. Paddlers were observed
during three field trips to the New River Gorge in West Virginia. We rafted
the river to gain first-hand knowledge of its features so that we could
ask relevant questions. We also watched guides teaching others about the
river. Over 30 interviews were conducted in which we adopted an incident-based
approach to elicit what paddlers know best (i.e., their experiences with
close calls and accidents). Using the critical decision method, we asked
paddlers to tell an entire story and then we followed up with questions
to clarify critical decision-making points [3]. This corpus of incidents
was used to identify ways to aid paddlers. <BR>
<BR>
In the interviews, paddlers were encouraged to draw or annotate diagrams
of rapids to help recall and explain the situations. In the example shown
in Figure 3, the kayaker did not make a turn in time and was temporarily
pinned by an undercut rock. He had not realized how much harder a previous
day's route would be at a lower level. This pointed to the need for route
recommendations that are tailored to different water levels. His story also
indicated the need to show boat angle and size on recommended routes as
well the relation of the route to flow strength and direction. In general,
incidents like this one emphasized the need to put data into context and
highlight relationships. <BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="dsr_fg3.gif" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="171" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
<B>Figure 3.</B> A paddler's sketch of a critical incident in which he was
temporarily pinned. </CENTER>
<P>To further build our corpus of critical incidents, we found the Internet
to be a fruitful source. In the paddlers' newsgroup, we monitored postings
and sent out probe messages to see what information people share. A critical
incident survey was also posted. Many stories of mishaps were described
in the posts. Advice on running specific rapids abounded. We also came across
postings warning others about new hazards which unpredictably arise in this
dynamic physical world. For example, boaters warned others about trees that
fell over into the river creating lethal strainers. These warnings showed
us that paddlers need to update each other after their trips to keep the
virtual world synchronized with the physical world. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Context-Sensitive Needs Due to Flow Changes</B><BR>
Before deciding to run a river, paddlers need to know the difficulty of
rapids at the projected level. The nature of rapids changes drastically
depending on the volume of water indicating the need for putting data into
context. As the flow changes, some hydraulics, known as holes, can be transformed
from friendly surfing spots to deadly keepers which will recirculate an
unwary paddler forever (Figure 4). The degree and pattern of recirculation
for any hole indicates the level of threat. Flow changes also expose rocks
that may pin a boat, drowning a paddler who flips. Other types of dangers
exist (e.g., rock sieves, whirlpool eddies, and pourovers). The threat posed
by each hazard depends on its shape, size, location, and the flow amount.
The implication is that virtual representations need to show how flow relates
to these aspects of each feature. Merely labeling hazards with icons or
words would be insufficient. <BR>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
<BR>
<B>Figure 4.</B> Keeper holes are one river hazard that can fatally trap
a boater. </CENTER>
<P><B>Decision Making Challenges</B><BR>
As in many activities, paddlers manage risk by judging their ability, the
difficulty, and the safety consequences for a particular run. Decision making
dilemmas arise due to the difficulty of knowing these relative limits in
an environment filled with uncertainties (e.g., gaps in knowledge, misrepresentations,
or hidden obstacles). Most accidents occur when paddlers are completely
surprised by hazards. They may miss hazards because their water reading
skills are not sufficiently developed. In other cases, they may be misled
by inaccurate or superficial descriptions of rapids. For instance, several
kayakers have been fatally pinned by a small undercut rock on a seemingly
innocuous rapid on the New River because this rock only becomes a hazard
at low levels and is not mentioned in any guidebook. Decision making is
further complicated by the fact that heuristics break down. For example,
paddlers cannot always assume that a rapid becomes more difficult at greater
flows. Hazards may be completely washed out at high flows. Low or intermediate
flows may in fact be more dangerous. Knowing what changes mean is critical.
Computers as decision aids are very well-suited to tailoring representations
to changes in an environment. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Problems Due to Over-Generalized Ratings</B><BR>
Boaters check gauge readings to find out river levels. However, a number
from a gauge is a poor indicator of rapid difficulty. One number fails to
capture what flow means. For example, in attempting to interpret 1500 cubic
feet per second, a paddler must know the difficulty rating which others
assign the rapid at that level (on a scale from Class I to VI). The rating
assigned to the rapid generalizes over many factors, and consequently it
fails to tell the entire story. A rapid rating of Class IV does not indicate
the types, locations, and number of hazards. It also fails to mention the
recommended lines and whether the high rating is due to technical difficulty
or safety threats. Abstractions like expert ratings are useful heuristics,
but decision making uncertainty is increased when their basis is hidden.
Visualizations are needed that abstract out the meaning of flow changes
to paddlers. The relations between expert interpretations and the physical
world must be shown. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Communication Problems and Needs</B><BR>
Several incidents pointed to the need for shared frames of reference and
extended communication abilities. The following two examples provide some
insight: 
<UL>
<LI><I>Underspecified instructions.</I> One canoeist did not adequately
explain how to avoid a large hole so a novice became trapped in it. Her
advice was to &quot;go left,&quot; instead of &quot;you need to go within
ten feet of the left bank and then ferry hard across strong current which
is about 100 yards wide.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Ambiguous gestures.</I> A private rafter gestured by raising his
hands in parallel. A companion assumed that meant &quot;river clear&quot;.
It really meant to follow along either bank to avoid a pourover in the middle
of the river. This boater ended up in the pourover. 
</UL>
These two examples show the communication limitations in this physical setting.
Virtual representations provide a new means for joint reference. Paddlers
may more precisely specify plans to others by annotating graphics with marks
or gestures and then pointing to features in the real world. Moreover, communication
can be extended over a greater distance and over the noise of the rapids.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Main Insights from the Field Studies</B><BR>
The principle conclusions include the following: 
<UL>
<LI><I>Reading water is a knowledge-intensive skill.</I> It takes many years
to learn how to interpret complex, noisy hydrotopography to identify safe
routes and hazards. Representation aiding offers a way to speed up and improve
the learning process. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Current representations are not context-sensitive. </I>Guidebooks
are incomplete and inaccurate, because they generally describe rapids for
an average water level. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Cognitive activity is distributed.</I> Knowledge is spread out across
artifacts and people [4]. Facilitating the sharing of knowledge is a key
leverage point. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><I>Communication breakdowns occur.</I> Paddlers consult others when
making decisions more than we expected. In most of the incidents, mishaps
occurred due to underspecified or ambiguous instructions. 
</UL>
<H2><HR>Developing the Rapid Scout Concept</H2>
In our field research, we discovered many on-the-river needs. Significant
opportunities existed for improving communication over people, time, and
distance using computers. With a down-the-river guide, we sought to use
graphic representations to provide a shared virtual frame of reference.
Prototyping this Rapid Scout concept enabled us to explore issues relevant
to integrating virtual and physical environments. We needed to put data
into context, show relationships, highlight change and events, and draw
contrasts. In creating it, we also would have to determine how multiple
virtual perspectives can be coupled with the physical views to enhance and
extend our senses. Representations would also have to be tailored to a specific
water level to satisfy the requirement for context-sensitive information.
Once we converged on these goals, we divided the design into three parts:
representation, communication, and hardware aspects of the prototype. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Virtual Representation Design</B><BR>
A key goal was to facilitate the sharing of knowledge across many distributed
cognitive agents both on and off the river. These agents included kayakers,
canoeists, raft guides, rescue squads, and park rangers. Information needs
and agent interactions were characterized based on rapid- and group-specific
scenarios. Five expert paddlers familiar with the New River Gorge were consulted
to identify rapid-specific scenarios and representation needs. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Designing Views, Structure, and Transitions</I><BR>
Our team, which included one kayaker, then identified possible views of
the river, and compared their strengths and weaknesses. Physically-available
views are often very limited (e.g., where steep canyon walls make it impossible
to scout from the shore). Virtual views which are not limited by physical
constraints provide new ways to expand what paddlers can see. Paddlers can
be shown an overview of an entire rapid, an otherwise inaccessible side
view, or overviews which show what is just around the bend. From our analysis,
we chose the views that would give paddlers the most appropriate information
for the selected scenarios. We avoided the garden path tendency to provide
every single possible view of a rapid. Such a default approach only increases
user input, navigation, and tailoring burdens. <BR>
<BR>
By showing view sketches and scenario-based storyboards to users, we determined
that the following views would be prototyped: a full map view of the river,
half-mile overviews, a top-of-the-rapid view, a Triptik, bird's eye overviews
of each rapid, and video close-ups of particularly dangerous hazards or
difficult drops. In addition, we planned screens for rating personal ability,
depicting the basis for rapid ratings, as well as saving and sharing annotations
and stories. <BR>
<BR>
In using Rapid Scout, a boater first would download or buy information about
a specific river or region. Links to automated river level gauges could
then be made to download flow readings to tailor the representations to
the current level. Upon arriving at the river put-in, a paddler would call
up the full-map view of the river. This view shows the river layout with
all rapids, access points, and other geographical information. A guide's
narrative with introductory video clips can also be played to learn about
highlights and the most difficult rapids. <BR>
<I><BR>
Half-Mile and Triptik Overviews</I><BR>
While paddling downstream, the user can transition to successive half-mile
views (see Figure 5). At this scale, these overviews encompass flat water
sections and a few of the upcoming rapids. The location of the user and
other paddlers with the device is shown within the 10-meter accuracy enabled
by global positioning systems. Major river features such as wave trains
also become visible in these views. Virtual landmarks are highlighted that
can serve as points of reference to deal with uncertain data. For instance,
two rocks which form a saddle on the New River are shown as a virtual reference
point for verifying river level. When the saddle is filled, the user can
confirm that river is indeed over three feet. The half-mile views serve
three main purposes: (a) showing what is around the bend to support anticipation;
(b) tracking a paddler's location relative to friends, groups, landmarks,
and rapids; as well as (c) supporting targeted communication through the
selection of boater symbols (discussed in the next section). <BR>

<BR>
<B>Figure 5.</B> Half-mile and Triptik overview. </CENTER>
<P>Two other mini-views are overlaid on the half-mile view. First, a top-of-the-rapid
photo can be called up to facilitate recognition of rapids (providing another
way to verify virtual-physical location). Secondly, a condensed and flattened
Triptik showing the sequence of rapid names and a paddler's progress is
provided on the right side of the half-mile view. Space limitations prevented
the use of a full river map so we decided to provide this straightened-out
view. The Triptik enables gauging the time left to complete the river. It
also serves as a scrolling bar and menu providing a physical frame of reference
for navigating to other views for communication and planning purposes. <BR>
<I>Bird's Eye Overviews</I><BR>
When paddlers reach the top of a rapid, they can then switch to the bird's
eye overview of that rapid (see Figure 6). It provides a big picture of
a rapid's layout which is comparable to an aerial photo from 500 feet. It
extends what a paddler can see in the physical world (e.g., showing the
downstream side of a &quot;blind drop&quot;). It also shows them an undistorted
layout of the rapid. In this view, we heavily use layering and separation
techniques [5]. Given our exploratory prototyping approach, we separated
layers of information so that we could discover useful combinations of layers
(see Figure 7 for the layer model). We anticipated combining layers later
on to simplify interaction. <BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="dsr_fg6.gif" WIDTH="234" HEIGHT="374" ALIGN=bottom
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
<BR>
<B>Figure 6.</B> Bird's eye overview of a rapid. </CENTER>
<P>Due to the importance of flow as a unifying factor, we chose to represent
it in the base layer of the bird's eye view. Flow is shown in relation to
other features by an animated texture map. This map is a micro-macro representation
that uses tiny lines varying in length and direction to form meaningful
flow patterns [5]. The patterns indicate relative sizes of features such
as waves to indicate degrees of difficulty and danger. Safe limits are highlighted
on the analogical representation of flow to provide meaningful alarms in
context. For instance, we highlight when the a hole's recirculation turns
it into a grabby keeper. Features below the surface which are hard to spot
even with trained eyes are also shown on this base layer (e.g., undercut
shapes of rocks). Showing these hidden features once again demonstrates
how virtual representations provide unique capabilities for extending views
into the physical world. <BR>
<BR>
Additional layers include grid scales, recommended routes, and simulated
previews (Figure 7). Video close-ups from shore-side scouting locations
also are available as options. We chose to provide the recommended routes
as optional layers because we maintain that users must have a basic understanding
of the physical world before they are presented an expert's advice. Such
an understanding allows them to better judge the validity of decision aid
advice and teaches them the basis of recommendations [6]. Providing video
close-ups of hazards as separate layers permitted access to more detail
and different vantage points in a way that simplified navigation and reduced
clutter. <BR>

<P><B>Evaluating the Prototype in the Field and Lab</B><BR>
Our river representations were evaluated iteratively at different stages
using sketches, flip books, and computer prototypes. The emphasis was on
discovering significant requirements (e.g., what layers should be combined)
rather than on identifying minor glitches (e.g., font sizes need to be increased).
We used simple as well as more functional prototypes in order to collect
data early on. One such simple prototype was the laminated flip book that
we used in field evaluations. The flip book included the full map, half-mile
views, bird's eye overviews of two rapids, and layers which could be added
to the overview (e.g., feature details, grid, and routes). Eight paddlers
duct-taped these flip books to their spray skirts immediately before these
two rapids to determine the usefulness of the representations in context
(see Figure 8). Several insights for improving the representations were
gained through this in situ testing. Ways to more accurately represent flow
and the degree of hole recirculation were pointed out. Better layering schemes
also became apparent leading us to combine the base water flow layer with
the hazards layer. <BR>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
<BR>
<B>Figure 8.</B> Paddlers using the flip book prototype before a rapid during
the field evaluation. </CENTER>
<P>We also conducted user tests with an interactive prototype. We first
provided a guidebook description of a rapid [7]. Then, we asked the user
to explain how to run the rapid at 3.5 feet to an experimenter who role-played
a novice who was not familiar with the rapid. We then asked each subject
to perform the same task for two different rapids using a dynamic computer
prototype. Natural verbal protocols were collected and analyzed. <BR>
<BR>
Our findings from the field and lab evaluations included: 
<UL>
<LI>Tailoring the virtual representations to the particular water level
greatly reduced paddler confusion. In contrast, paddlers using the guidebook
had to repeatedly re-read the description to see if the advice was relevant.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The representations captured the essence of expert descriptions though
we discovered several ways to improve them (e.g., by altering the flow texture
map). <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Transitions between views and layers needed to be streamlined to improve
navigation between displays. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>A shared frame of reference greatly reduced ambiguity in communication.
Moreover, less effort was required to direct another person's attention
to specific features. 
</UL>
<B>Design for On-the-River Communication</B><BR>
Drawing from the corpus of cases, we developed several on-the-river communication
scenarios which we used to specify requirements, design solutions, and evaluate
the prototype. Routine scenarios included an expert explaining a route to
a novice before and after the expert runs it, an instructor teaching a class
how to run a rapid, and a 20 person paddling club with interchanging subgroups.
Non-routine scenarios which expose brittleness were also considered (e.g.,
when people become separated, equipment is lost, parts of the device fails,
or a person is injured). <BR>
<BR>
Two types of communication appeared necessary; namely, an open form and
a targeted form of communication. The open form of communication is analogous
to posting on newsgroups where preset groups are contacted. Whereas, the
targeted communication is like e-mail which is directed to specific locations
of people or groups. In designing the open communication means, many ideas
came to us from our observations of the use of voice loops at NASA Mission
Control. Based on their example and our requirements, we adopted a channel-based
system that has two volume levels to support monitoring and talking on several
channels at once. Channels being monitored are set at the lower volume to
minimize distraction while still taking advantage of our divided attention
ability. The scenarios helped us specify the number of channels needed and
their function dedications. We included ten general-purpose channels, a
&quot;park ranger&quot; channel, a &quot;chatting&quot; channel, and an
option to broadcast simultaneously to all channels. Channels were monitored
or talked on by pressing buttons on the edge of the device. The degree of
button depression providing feedback about whether the channel was being
monitored or talked on. <BR>
<BR>
In addition to the channel metaphor, we allowed for targeted communication.
By selecting boat symbols from the half-mile views of the river, a user
could talk directly to that boater or group (see Figure 5). By directing
messages to only those people for which they are intended, this means of
communication promised to reduce nuisance broadcasts and improve privacy.
It also provided a physical frame of reference for organizing the communication
options. <BR>
<BR>
Although both means of communication looked promising, we were unsure about
which method would be the most useful in different circumstances. In keeping
with the exploratory prototyping approach, the two communication paradigms
were combined to discover in future user tests when each method is most
appropriate. When combined with the graphic shared frame of reference, these
open and targeted means of communication promised to extend the communication
abilities of paddlers significantly. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Hardware Design</B><BR>
The most striking aspect of the hardware design process was our ability
to discard prototypes when new requirements were discovered. Prototypes
were used to explore the constraint space rather than to refine a single
concept. <BR>
<BR>
The primary consideration when exploring this space was the user's safety.
Many ideas were abandoned after interviews and testing with users showed
that they could become entangled on river objects or impair swimming. Some
of these discarded prototypes and additional requirements included: 
<UL>
<LI>A hardback screen placed in a transparent pocket on the spray skirt
was rejected because it could cause the skirt to implode under heavy water
pressure.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>A hardback-pullout screen housed in a drawer on the front of the kayak
was dropped because it would cover the safety quick-release loop on the
spray skirt.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>A flexible pull-out screen attached to the spray skirt was a success
with paddlers in our usability tests, but was judged to be too futuristic.
</UL>
Eventually, the requirements that we met were that the device be waterproof,
shockproof, compact, light, rigid, and glare-resistant. In addition, the
device could not interfere with swimming, pulling off the spray skirt, paddling,
or walking. It also had to be readily accessible and easy to use in relatively
calm eddies. Furthermore, we decided that equipment alterations were undesirable
to keep costs down and to make it easy to rent the device from outfitters,
or to share it with fellow boaters. <BR>
<BR>
The latest prototype is a PDA-sized device which will be encased in a rubber
coating and attached to the front of the paddler by a neoprene belt (see
Figure 9). Interaction with the magnetically-sensitive touch screen is conducted
using a glove with magnetized finger tips (normal electrostatic touch screens
had to be ruled out because of the water). This solution satisfies the above
requirements though we still view it as an exploratory tool. <BR>
<BR>
Similar portable hardware already is being introduced to such sports environments
(e.g., PDAs with GPS links). However, these devices generally only provide
user location coordinates. In the long run, these products should aim to
incorporate more functionality and information as illustrated by the Rapid
Scout concept. <BR>

<H2><HR>Conclusion</H2>
Rapid Scout brings together scattered knowledge and expands paddler communication
abilities on the river. In designing it, we have tackled challenges including:
<UL>
<LI>abstracting out critical relationships to show people what they need
to look for in the physical world (e.g., analogical representations of the
degree of threat), <BR>
<BR>
<LI>providing context-sensitive information (e.g., tailoring to flow changes),
<BR>
<BR>
<LI>extending user perspectives with virtually-possible views and abstractions
(e.g., bird's eye overview), <BR>
<BR>
<LI>highlighting important contrasts and change (e.g., micro-macro texture
map), <BR>
<BR>
<LI>indicating safety-critical limits and hidden hazards (e.g., showing
degrees of recirculation), <BR>
<BR>
<LI>dealing with an unpredictable environment (e.g., providing updating,
annotation, and sharing abilities), <BR>
<BR>
<LI>coordinating multiple virtual perspectives with available views in the
physical world (e.g., through navigation mechanisms), <BR>
<BR>
<LI>addressing severe constraints on portable computing in this rough environment
(e.g., synchronizing interaction with paddling downtimes), <BR>
<BR>
<LI>improving communication (e.g., providing a shared frame of reference
and supporting collaboration over a greater distance and the noise of the
rapids). 
</UL>
Recent advances in technology (e.g., GPS, portable computing) have provided
the designer with new opportunities for bridging the gulf between physical
and virtual environments. The key to harnessing the power of virtuality
and ensuring that a new design will function as a useful tool is to gain
an in-depth understanding through user-centered methodologies such as field
investigations and exploratory prototyping.
