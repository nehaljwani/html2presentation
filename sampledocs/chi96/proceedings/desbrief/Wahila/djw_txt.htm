<H3>ABSTRACT</H3>
As part of the 1995 Apple Design Project, we designed and prototyped the muse, a 
digital music stand for the symphony musician. Our group consisted of four students 
from Carnegie Mellon University. We worked closely with members of the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra during the development of our product. By observing their practice, 
rehearsal, and performance habits, we studied the symphony culture and generated the 
concept of a product that would replace a number of conventional tools and processes 
with a single digital device. The integration of the interface and industrial design resulted 
in a cohesive look and feel to the muse. The muse contains a metronome with audio and 
visual feedback, a pitch-generating tuner, stylus-based on-screen annotation, inter-
symphony communication capabilities, a music library, and manual or automatic page 
turning with indexing. The muse is fashioned from mahogany, aluminum, and steel to 
reflect the timeless beauty of the instruments with which it shares the stage.

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
During the Spring of 1995, Carnegie Mellon University participated in the Apple Design 
Project. Our group, consisting of four members, combined varied academic talents and 
generated a product idea for a digital music stand for the symphony musician. Our areas 
of academic pursuits included graphic design, industrial design, professional writing, 
computer science, fine art, theater set design, and anthropology. Perhaps our greatest 
challenge was overcoming the lack of musical performance experience that plagued all of 
us.
<P>

Our goal was to create a product that reflected the culture and practice of symphony 
musicians. In order to understand fully the needs of the symphony musician, we 
observed, studied, researched, and interviewed members of the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Orchestra. The resulting product concept was the muse.
<P>

The muse facilitates the individual practice, group rehearsal, and formal performance 
needs of symphony musicians. The muse consists of a portable digital display and 
matching stand. The features of the muse include a metronome with audio and visual 
feedback, a pitch-generating tuner, stylus-based on-screen annotation, inter-symphony 
communication capabilities, a music library, and manual or automatic page turning with 
indexing.
<BR><P>
<BR><P>

<H3>DEFINING OUR PROBLEM AND APPROACH</H3>
Our research began with a survey, distributed over twenty Internet newsgroups. It 
queried musicians on practice and rehearsal habits, preferences, and problems. We 
received over 100 responses from musicians of all types: rock, jazz, classical, amateur, 
student, and professional. Some of the ideas introduced as a result of survey responses 
included automatic page turning, computer accompaniment, score arrangement, and self-
generating music.
<P>

Given our decision to work with professional symphony musicians, we compiled the 
responses which were appropriate for that setting and developed a follow-up survey to 
send out to classical musicians who had responded to the first survey. We received 
approximately forty responses to this second survey which provided us with the 
perspectives of many different musicians and the seeds for many of the ideas we 
eventually incorporated into the muse. An even more beneficial outcome of the survey 
were the personal contacts we made, most significantly Harold Smoliar, the English Horn 
player for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO).
<P>

We were very cautious in our initial dealings with the PSO. We anticipated much 
resistance from the symphony, whom we believed would be a "socially sophisticated and 
technophobic" audience. Although these stereotypes were quite strong and seemingly 
justified, they were wrong.
<P>

The PSO is a professional orchestra rooted in centuries-old traditions. We feared that 
trying to change the methods and habits of these musicians might prove futile. We knew 
that we needed to present our ideas to them with reserve and in incremental steps. If we 
had brought a finished prototype to our first focus group, the group might have viewed us 
as too forceful and close-mined. We did not have a predetermined solution before we 
began this project, and we wanted to make sure the PSO understood that. Our design 
process relied heavily on the musicians' input.
<BR><P>
<BR><P>

<H3>GATHERING DATA</H3>
<B>Background Research</B><BR>
Before attending our first rehearsal, we researched the workings and practices of 
symphony orchestras. We purchased literature of the trade, studied seating charts, 
conductors' movements, and each musician's seating and body positions in relation to that 
musician's instrument. Using this information we were able to familiarize ourselves with 
the musicians' vocabulary and acquire the basic information necessary for making future 
decisions. We also used this research to define industrial design constraints, such as the 
size and weight of our product based on existing limitations like storage space and 
maximum transportation weights.
<P>

<B>Expert Informant</B><BR>
Harold, our symphony contact, became an invaluable advisor. He answered our (almost 
daily) barrage of questions, acted as a sounding-board for untested product ideas before 
we presented them to a focus group, introduced us to visiting conductors and other PSO 
musicians, and most importantly, arranged our many visits to Heinz Hall, the home of the 
PSO.
<P>

<B>Symphony Observations</B><BR>
By attending a number of rehearsals and performances at Heinz Hall, we began to 
understand the routines and roles of the musicians and the conductor. We documented 
these behaviors on video and later used them to pinpoint areas of communication 
concerns between the conductor and musicians, musicians in the same section, or 
musicians in different sections. Rehearsals were our first exposure to the symphony 
"backstage." Understanding what musicians did with their music when they were not on 
stage was equally as important since the muse would replace their printed music in all 
situations. We needed to thoroughly understand the environment before we could design a 
suitable product for our intended audience.
<P>

<B>Interviews with Others</B><BR>
In addition to our meetings with the PSO musicians, we spoke with music students on the 
Carnegie Mellon campus and faculty in the music and computer science departments. 
Specifically, we consulted with a Computer Science faculty member to discuss the 
feasibility of the technology we intended to use. He critiqued the methods and hardware 
we were proposing and offered some alternate methods which were adopted. Although 
the PSO was our audience, we utilized other resources which could provide technical 
feedback and opinions on the functionality of the muse. 
<BR><P>
<BR><P>

<H3>NEEDS AND PRACTICES</H3>
<B>The Three Situations for Use of the muse</B><BR>
After gathering data and speaking with our various contacts, we were able to define three 
distinct situations for using the muse: practice, rehearsal, and performance. At home, 
musicians learn their music, practicing it to the point that they are competent and can 
recognize where special attention is needed. Rehearsal is where the conductor and the 
musicians work to bring the piece together. The focus is on cues and the 'sound of the 
symphony' -- not on the individuals. Performance is the culmination of practice and 
rehearsal; after weeks of practice and one week of rehearsal, the piece is performed for an 
audience, and the cycle begins again.
<P>

<B>Communications on the Stage</B><BR>
We could see that communication problems existed once the rehearsal began. The 
orchestra's apparent lack of organization and order  while "tuning up" before the maestro 
arrived on stage was unexpected -- a significant contrast to a symphony performance. 
Often the maestro would have trouble conveying which note in the score he was referring 
to. Several times when musicians tried to describe something to him communication broke 
down.
<P>

When a musician has a concern, that musician consults a peer, the first chair of the 
section, or the conductor. While speaking with a "neighbor," it is common for the 
musician to rotate their own stand and point at the music in question. When the 
communication spans the stage, such as to the conductor, it is impossible to indicate 
where the area of concern is on the printed music -- it must be described verbally. This in 
turn causes problems of audibility. For instance, when the first chair violin gives a 
directive to the violin section, the musicians sitting in the last row often have difficulty 
hearing them. All of these competing conversations and communications create a complex 
web of interactions among musicians on the stage.
<P>

<B>Annotation</B><BR>
Annotation is a large part of the symphony rehearsal: Musicians make notes on their 
printed music based on personal observations or feedback from their first chair, 
conductor, or peers. Musicians also mark up their music in practice, but only with notes 
specific to their needs.
<P>

<B>Page Turning</B><BR>
While musicians in some sections of the symphony have the luxury of individual music 
stands, string musicians must share stands. When two musicians share a stand, the 
individual sitting on the inside of the orchestra (away from the audience) must turn the 
page. In most cases, a page break occurs during a rest for the particular instrument. When 
it is does not, the musician who is required to turn the page must stop playing. Thus, in a 
performance, page turning actually results in perceptible "dips" in the music's volume. In 
rehearsal, page turns may occur in both directions since the conductor may choose to 
focus on a part of the composition and rehearse it over and over. We needed to address 
both types of page turning.
<P>

<B>Tuning</B><BR>
Whether for a rehearsal or performance, each time a musician comes on to stage, they tune 
their instruments. Different symphonies tune to different A pitches. The most common 
pitch used is the 'concert A'  (440 Hertz). Some symphonies tune to A444 or even A415. 
This discrepancy is not common, but without it, the muse would be unusable to some 
symphonies. 
<P>

<B>Music Management</B><BR>
We discussed with the Heinz Hall music librarians the problems associated with current 
methods of music distribution. Only a few musical scores are not copyrighted -- it is 
those pieces that PSO owns and can to play free of charge. We learned that the majority 
of the music the symphony plays is laden with copyrights. For pieces that the 
Symphony rents, there are performance licensing terms. The terms of the rental contract 
depend on whom the symphony is performing the piece for, as well as, the percentage of 
the composition that they will be playing.
<BR><P>
<BR><P>

<H3>FUNCTIONALITY AND ENABLING TECHNOLOGY</H3>
As a result of our visits to PSO rehearsals, and our meetings with Carnegie Mellon 
faculty, staff, and students, the features of the muse began to take shape. We compiled 
our observations, focused our ideas, decided on the final functionality of the muse, and 
determined how that functionality would be conveyed to the musicians (i.e. what tools 
we would provide). However, we did not decide at this point which functions would have 
a hard interface (buttons, switches, stylus) and which would be completely embodied in 
the software interface.
<P>

<B>Functionality</B><BR>
After reviewing the information gathered, we decided on the "tools" and functions to 
include in the muse: (1) Musicians were delighted with the prospect of eliminating manual 
page turning from the symphony performance and letting the muse control it. However, 
page turning still needed to be under the musician's control, since automatic page turning  
would not be helpful in all rehearsal situations. (2) Since musicians are constantly writing 
on their scores, we wanted to provide a function for annotation --Êone that allowed for the 
marks from the conductor and first chair of each section could be distributed to the rest of 
the symphony, eliminating the arduous task of copying notations by hand. (3) Nearly 
every musician owned a metronome and a tuner. Including these devices in the muse 
would reduce the number of devices musicians carried onto stage. This feature could be 
integrated with other muse functions like annotated tempo changes. (4) A method was 
needed for musicians to access other instruments' parts and allow them to view select 
parts of the entire symphonic score as the piece is played -- creating a redundant system 
of cueing. (5) By including a library tool, musicians would be able to download music 
from the Heinz Hall Collection, store it locally, and display it on the muse.
<P>

In addition to these functions, we needed an area reserved for setting preferences that 
controlled how the features of the muse behaved for each musician (such as the size of 
music displayed, the tonal range of each instrument, page turning settings, etc.).
<P>

<B>Enabling Technologies</B><BR>
<I>Batteries</I><BR>
The muse had to be able to operate at locations outside of Heinz Hall, such as, at other 
music halls or at home. Batteries were necessary to afford this portability. Because it 
would be impractical for a musician to carry the stand around with the display each time 
they moved, the display must be able to run independent of the base. Hence, the display 
needed its own power supply. These battery requirements impacted the industrial design, 
so it was important to identify these needs and find solutions early in the design process. 
We researched compact rechargeable batteries with long-lasting power and a short 
recharge time which matched our needs.
<P>

<I>Wireless</I><BR>
In order for the muse to receive music from the Heinz Hall Collection, some sort of data 
communication must be possible. To avoid wires strung around the stage during a 
rehearsal or performance which would impede musicians walking on stage, wireless 
connections would be used. This network would increase security and prevent potential 
copying of musical scores through the use of data compression and encryption.
<P>

<I>Microphones</I><BR>
To include a tuner and automatic page turning in the muse we needed a small, accurate 
microphone with low power consumption. When a musician is using the tuner to tune an 
instrument during rehearsal, the microphone must discern that instrument's tones from 
those of the surrounding instruments.
<P>

<I>Software</I><BR>
In the early stages of the design process, it was necessary to confirm that we were not 
replicating any existing products. Speaking to personal computer software distributors, 
we discovered products that support arrangement and notation of music, and allow for 
electronic composition and publishing of music. We realized that much of the current 
technology could be used in our product. One package's scanning ability could be used by 
music distributors to transform sheet music into digital form, and a derivative of 
Vivace's[1] real-time accompaniment technology could be used to facilitate automatic page 
turning.
<BR><P>
<BR><P>

<H3>INDUSTRIAL DESIGN AND INTERFACE DESIGN</H3>
Our design process was iterative -- not only in the software interface, but also in the 
industrial design. The research we performed and the interviews we conducted also had an 
iterative flavor; as the product definition grew in detail, we refined our research techniques 
and in turn yielded better feedback from the musicians.
<P>

As we learned more about symphony musicians, our initial concepts changed, along with 
the features of the product. We first believed that classical symphony musicians would be 
resistant to change -- that they would not be interested in the advantages that the muse 
had to offer.
<P>

<B>First Iteration</B><BR>
The first designs showed our initial hesitation to break away from convention. The stand 
still reflected the traditional music stand, and the interface widgets visually mimicked 
conventional devices. While we were exploring new ideas and approaches we tended to 
keep looking to the past for inspiration and guidance.
<P>

<I>Industrial Design</I><BR>
Our first step was to build a display sketch model to understand better the scale that we 
were proposing. We decided early in the process to use screen sizes of 9 by 12 inches per 
page <A HREF="djw_f001.gif">(see Figure 1)</A> -- slightly larger than the 
conventional printed music that the PSO uses. Since this is a rather large finished size and 
we wanted the display portion to be portable, it needed to fold in half.
<P>

Our first stands <A HREF="djw_f002.gif">(see Figure 2)</A> were part of a series of 
semantic studies to see how we could improve on the traditional music stand. The issues 
that we were concerned with were mobility, flexibility, weight, location of the power 
source, and how the stand would support the display.
<P>

<I>Interface</I><BR>
We began prototyping the interface with only two tools: the tuner and the metronome. 
We believed that using a metronome modeled after a conventional metronome would be a 
logical extension of the musicians' knowledge <A HREF="djw_f003.gif">(see Figure 
3)</A>. For similar reasons, we modeled the tuner design after a conventional analog 
tuner <A HREF="djw_f004.gif">(see Figure 4)</A>. Again, we planned to use the 
musicians' familiarity with a physical tool to teach them how to use a digital tool.
<P>

<I>Feedback</I><BR>
We presented the first iteration informally to PSO musicians, CMU faculty, and 
students. From responses to the presentations, we learned that digital metronomes were 
used instead of the analog type we had modeled our interface after. The tuner was 
described as awkward and visually confusing, almost more of a display then a tool for 
tuning. The symphony musicians commented that the bases for the stand were too long 
and potentially obtrusive for some musicians such as the harpist or basist <A 
HREF="djw_f005.gif">(see Figure 5)</A>.
<P>

<B>Second Iteration</B><BR>
After reevaluating our interface designs, we noticed that they seemed very disjointed from 
the industrial design of the product. Furthermore, as we tried to design tools such as the 
library that could not be represented as literal as a tuner and a metronome, we realized 
that the metaphors we were clinging to could potentially confuse the musicians and create 
uglier, jumbled screens. 
<P>

<I>Industrial Design</I><BR>
Realizing that the stand would be sharing the stage with million dollar instruments, we 
experimented with more graceful forms and materials that reflected those in the 
instruments on stage. Mahogany, aluminum, and steel became our materials of choice, and 
the form began to diverge from the conventional look of a music stand. Creating a wooden 
support arm that came out of the base not only gave the shaft more support, but allowed 
a beautiful contrast of materials. In addition, we refined ideas about where the power 
sources within the stand and display should be placed and how they would work together 
<A HREF="djw_f006.gif">(see Figure 6)</A>.
<P>

<I>Interface</I><BR>
As the industrial design progressed, we were very intrigued by its graceful form. We 
experimented with bent steel for the tube that supported the stand. Inspired by the basic 
form and gesture of the industrial design, we returned to the drawing board and generated 
new sketches of the interface tools. 
<P>

We found that by trading the metaphors we had been working with for a new, 
nonrepresentational design language and a limited color palette, we were able to design the 
tools with a cohesive form language that reflected the industrial design and worked 
together as a family. Each tool had a linear element that surrounded areas of colors (see 
<A HREF="djw_f007.gif">Figure 7</A>, <A HREF="djw_f008.gif">Figure 8</A>, <A 
HREF="djw_f009.gif">Figure 9</A> for examples). The functionality of each tool was 
contained in the colored area, with different colors establishing a hierarchy within each 
tool. By keeping the tools simple, all the interactions with the muse could be achieved 
through a small set of interface widgets.
<P>

The challenge we faced in designing these tools was how to lead the musicians through the 
information space effectively. This was extremely difficult in the library tool, where there 
are potentially two libraries displayed at once and music needs to be moved from one 
collection to the other. To solve this issue, we employed the notion of progressive 
disclosure, first displaying the local library and then after an additional action by the 
musician, revealing the symphony's collection. Despite these challenges, we were able to 
communicate our intentions and the tools' functionality through scaleable interface 
elements.
<P>

<I>Feedback</I><BR>
When we presented the second iteration prototype to a focus group of ten symphony 
musicians, we received positive feedback concerning both the industrial design and the 
interface. They felt the selection of tools was appropriate and including devices like the 
tuner and metronome would reduce stage clutter if they were integrated into a single 
device. However, the musicians still had some concerns. They felt that the microphone 
was too far away to pick up the sound of an instrument, especially in a loud rehearsal. 
Many shared ideas about alternative ways to navigate manually through the music. The 
musicians also felt that navigation in the music should be facilitated by adding functions 
to reduce the possibility of "getting lost" during a  rehearsal or performance: Certain pages 
could be marked, a small screen could display the previous page, or a moving staff might 
show the measure being played.
<P>

Despite the musicians' positive feedback, we were careful not to implement any of their 
ideas without careful consideration. After analyzing their suggestions and compiling our 
own observations we began the final iteration. Simplicity was the key to making sure that 
all musicians could use the product without difficulty, and this drove our final design.
<BR><P>
<BR><P>

<H3>FINAL PRODUCT</H3>
<B>Physical Features</B><BR>
The muse is comprised of a portable digital music display and a matching stand to which 
the display attaches during rehearsals and performances. The display is foldable with two 
9"x 12" high resolution flat panel touch-sensitive displays, a built-in microphone, and two 
speakers. Inside the display is a hard drive for storage of musical scores and a wireless 
modem for inter-orchestral communication. The muse is powered by rechargeable 
batteries inside the display. These batteries are charged every time the musician uses the 
product on its stand -- which has its own rechargeable batteries. The stand and display 
are built from mahogany, aluminum, and steel to reflect the timeless beauty of the 
instruments with which they share the stage (see <A HREF="djw_f010.gif">Figure 
10</A>).
<P>

<B>Interface Features</B><BR>
<I>Automatic Page Turning</I><BR>
To facilitate a symphony performance, the muse listens to the musician and is constantly 
aware of that musician's location within the music being played.  The musician sets a 
position on the page that, when reached, cues the muse to turn the page. The pages are 
replaced individually, first on the left, and then on the right -- so there is never a break in 
the music. This eliminates the need for the musician to stop playing and interrupt 
concentration; the page turn is automatic. Alternatively, the musician can use a manual 
method to turn pages through two buttons located on the top corners of the display. 
These buttons turn one page forward or backwards when pressed with a hand, bow, or 
other device.
<P>

<I>Annotation</I><BR>
The musicians can mark up their music using the touch sensitive display and stylus. In 
addition to seeing their own markings, musicians can view the markings distributed across 
the orchestra by the conductor or the first chair of their section. This saves musicians the 
time and labor of copying the notation of several different people onto their own music. It 
also grants musicians the ability, during practice, to start with a "clean slate" by turning 
off all of their markings and focus on the music without any interpretations.
<P>

By allowing immediate annotation from a first chair or conductor to the musicians, a 
number of the communication problems normally associated with a symphony rehearsal 
can be alleviated. By sending the markings electronically, there is no confusion with the 
changes or to what they apply.
<P>

<I>Metronome</I><BR>
The metronome (see <A HREF="djw_f011.gif">Figure 11</A>) allows musicians to set 
tempos and preview them as sound clicks or a blinking light during practice and rehearsal. 
The metronome can be used to place multiple tempos in the score where the beat changes, 
so the feedback from the muse can automatically adjust as the musician plays the piece. 
This feedback can be turned on and off without deleting the tempo settings.
<P>

<I>Tuner</I><BR>
The tuner (see <A HREF="djw_f012.gif">Figure 12</A>) allows a musician to select a 
note in an instrument's range for tuning. The musician's instrument is set in the 
preferences menu of the muse, so that the appropriate scale is displayed for the musician 
to choose from. After the musician selects the desired note (generally the concert A), the 
tuner will play that pitch for the musician to match. As the musician plays the tone, the 
muse listens to the instrument and displays how sharp or flat the note is. Once the pitch 
matches the muse's tone, the tuner is automatically closed so the musician can 
immediately begin playing without having to release the instrument.
<P>

<I>Views</I><BR>
The views feature gives musicians access to the parts of any other instrument in a given 
score. This allows musicians to see their location in the score in relation to other 
instruments that they may be listening to for cues -- it gives them a visual cue in addition 
to an audio one. The pages are then repaginated on the muse to reflect the new staff(s) of 
music added to the display and will turn accordingly with automatic progression. 
<P>

<I>Library</I><BR>
Music is downloaded to the muse via wireless communication from the symphony's 
digital music library. Because of strict copyright laws surrounding music distribution and 
performance, permission would still need to be granted by the music librarians for 
personal requests. Musicians would have the ability to sort through the symphony 
library by composer, title, or performance date (see <A HREF="djw_f013.gif">Figure 
13</A>). After selecting a piece, a musician can download it to the personal collection on 
the hard drive in the muse, which has the capability to store 100 pieces of music. If the 
piece has certain copyright restrictions, the musician may have to wait for the request to 
be processed by one of the music librarians. Once downloaded to the muse, any of the 
music can be selected for display.
<P>

<I>Preferences</I><BR>
Every muse can be customized through preferences to meet the needs of individual 
musicians. The preferences include the musician's name, symphony name, instrument, 
page turning options, size of music displayed, etc. Once these preferences are set, their 
values affect the other six functions of the muse, allowing it to work with any musician 
playing any instrument.
<P>

<I>Notes</I><BR>
When the musician turns on the muse, a screen displays that musician's name, instrument, 
and orchestra. Layered on top of this text are personal notes and important symphony 
announcements from the personnel manager and symphony staff. After reading the notes 
the musician can close them by tapping on them with the stylus. These notes 
complement or replace the verbal announcements made at the start of every symphony 
rehearsal.
<BR><P>
<BR><P>

<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>
The iterative process must be central to an effective design methodology. When choosing 
a potentially resistant audience, it is necessary to present concepts at a basic level. Once 
an audience has accepted these ideas, more complex issues can be introduced. These 
cycles allow for the constant modification of previous work, and keep an audience 
engaged in the development. 
<P>

By maintaining cohesive industrial and interface designs, accompanied by a strategic 
design process, we were able to introduce new technology to, and spark the imagination 
of, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.
