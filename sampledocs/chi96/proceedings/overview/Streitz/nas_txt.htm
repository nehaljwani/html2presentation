The Integrated Publication and Information Systems Institute (<a
href="http://www.darmstadt.gmd.de/IPSI">IPSI</a>) was founded in 1987
as one of eight institutes of the <a
href="http://www.gmd.de">GMD-Forschungszentrum Informationstechnik
GmbH</a>. GMD is the German National Research Center for Information
Technology which is owned by the Federal Government and three State
Governments. An increasing proportion of the budget is coming from
contract work and cooperation with industry as well as from R&amp;D
programs of the European Union.  GMD is a distributed organization
employing a total of 1200 in three locations (St.Augustin, Berlin,
Darmstadt).
<P>
The institute (director: Erich Neuhold, deputy director: Norbert
Streitz) has a staff of 90 people and is organized in four divisions:
<a href="http://www-cui.darmstadt.gmd.de/">User Interfaces for
Information Systems</a> (Heinz-Dieter B&ouml;cker), <a
href="http://www.darmstadt.gmd.de/publish/">Cooperative Hypermedia
Systems</a> (Norbert Streitz), <a
href="http://este.darmstadt.gmd.de:5000/dimsys/">Distributed
Multimedia Information Management</a> (Wolfgang Klas), and <a
href="http://www.darmstadt.gmd.de/mipp/">Multimedia Information and
Publication Prototypes</a> (Klaus M&auml;tzel). Focussing here on HCI, we
restrict this overview to the first two divisions.  Members of IPSI
are also teaching at the Department of Computer Science at the
Technical University of Darmstadt based on a cooperation and a joint
appointment of Prof. Neuhold. The work at IPSI is based on a
deliberately interdisciplinary approach. This is manifested in the
disciplines constituting the background of its staff: computer
science, mathematics, linguistics, psychology, sociology, and
information sciences. At IPSI, work on HCI is very much application
driven but at the same time new problem domains and contexts require
an in-depth treatment of rather fundamental issues. Beyond
requirements from real world applications the design space is
constrained through models from cognitive science. Furthermore, we use
rapid prototyping cycles and involve end-users as much and as early as
possible.

<H2><a href="http://www-cui.darmstadt.gmd.de/">UI for Information Systems</a></H2>

The paradigm of standard information retrieval, i.e., the selection
of texts from a database to fulfill a single information need,
has been criticized as being largely inadequate for real world
information seeking behavior. To fruitfully exploit the next generation
of information intensive environments containing text, graphics,
pictures, and time dependent data, communication between human
and computer will have to take place at the <I>content level</I>.
This may also include the manipulation of iconic representatives
of problem domain objects. Since in information seeking activities
real users very often are unable to precisely express their needs
by means of a single query, it is becoming increasingly clear
to the information retrieval community that <I>interaction</I>
is the single most important concept for information seeking activities.
<P>
For content-oriented retrieval from multimedia databases our approach
combines methods from logic-based IR and object-oriented database
theory [<a href="#ref5">5</a>]. Because of the importance of
interaction, we use a comprehensive conversational dialogue model [<a
href="#ref1">1</a>,<a href="#ref6">6</a>] to develop a dialogue manager
for multimodal interaction. This is complemented by visualization
techniques for information seeking that exploit the human visual
system to deal with large amounts of information.
<P>
We have built sample environments to explore communication processes
between information providers and information seekers. Our prototypes
allow the communication of goals and intentions, they present
problems, suggestions and results to the user, and they are able
to follow a continuous problem solving dialogue between human
and computer, and keep that dialogue going. Our practical work
centers around the design of generic methods and tools to access,
visualize, reorganize, and restructure large amounts of multimedia
information.
<P>
Using high-end Silicon Graphics machines we have also built systems
that provide intuitive visualizations and direct-manipulative
interaction mechanisms to access and explore information stored in
very large multimedia knowledge- or databases. We design and construct
3D-visual information spaces [<a href="#ref3">3</a>] that retain more
of the descriptive dimensions of real worlds than traditional
information systems based on the desktop metaphor.  Explorations in
these environments can take place as spatial, 3D navigation on
visualizations of information networks or as interactions augmented by
retrieval mechanisms provided by the computer system. Appropriate
3D-visual metaphors are derived from real world behaviour of users and
from the structures of the explored information content as provided by
the data/knowledge base.


<H2><a href="http://www.darmstadt.gmd.de/publish/">Cooperative Hypermedia Systems</a></H2>

The application domain of hypermedia-based publication and
collaboration systems is located in the intersection of hypermedia,
CSCW, and HCI. This includes to build innovative examples of
integrated work environments supporting &quot;document-based&quot;
activities.  It is our understanding that in the context of
computer-supported cooperative work, hypermedia documents will not
only constitute the <I>subject matter </I>or <I>content</I> but also a
<I>medium</I> for communication, coordination, and
cooperation. Hypermedia documents suggest qualitatively new
possibilities for publishing, i.e. communicating knowledge. But
creating structure and content, adding value for electronic
publications also demands qualitatively enhanced support for authors,
editors, publishers, and users. Electronic documents can be put to use
in many different ways: as linear or nonlinear documents
(hyper<I>text</I>), containing multimedia, dynamic, and (inter)active
components (hyper<I>media</I>). <I>Interactive hyper</I>documents
require the design of new user interfaces.  But there is no
established tradition of creating and using hypermedia
documents. Thus, new approaches for designing <I>hyper</I>documents
are required [<a href="#ref9">9</a>]. Furthermore, we place a strong
emphasis on the cooperative actions necessary to create and edit
hypermedia [<a href="#ref7">7</a>].
<P>
From the broad spectrum of hypermedia applications, we selected
two areas to explore their innovative potential:
<P>
<I>1) Experimental and innovative electronic publications
</I>transcend the limits of print media and ask for new tools for the
planning, design and production of large hypermedia
publications. Examples are tailorable publications (e.g., individual
electronic newspaper), large reference works (e.g., Dictionary of
Art), and technical documentation. The tools include an editor's
workbench [<a href="#ref4">4</a>] utilizing an object-oriented
knowledge base and an automatic visualization environment for the
dynamic on-demand generation of hypermedia documents including
automatic layout.  <P>

<I>2) Hypermedia-based collaboration environments </I>are our approach
to CSCW. The supported activities range from group problem solving
(e.g. brainstorming, discussion, and decision making) in face-to-face
and &quot;virtual&quot; meetings to joint viewing and editing of
documents in distributed desktop-based collaboration using also
audio/video communication links. A prominent example is a project of
developing support for government agencies distributed between Bonn
and Berlin. The tools we built include the SEPIA cooperative
hypermedia authoring environment [<a href="#ref7">7</a>] providing
different degrees of shared workspaces and the DOLPHIN electronic
meeting room support system [<a href="#ref8">8</a>]. Integrating large,
interactive electronic whiteboards led to innovative pen-based
user-interfaces using gesture recognition techniques and to supporting
a wide range of structures from informal (e.g., scribbles) to formal
(e.g., typed node-link structures) and their visualization. These
cooperative work scenarios require also support for versioning of
hyperdocuments [<a href="#ref2">2</a>].

<H2>The Future</H2>

<P>
Finally, we will report about the directions to be pursued in
the future. Tools and methods developed to support information
seeking activities will be adapted and applied to networked information.
Building upon our expertise in constructing 3D visualizations
(built for TV productions employing virtual TV studios), we will
incorporate virtual reality techniques into CSCW scenarios. This
will be applied to our ATM-based coupling of two or more electronic
meeting rooms and several desktop-based remote partners in different
locations, creating &quot;Ubiquitous Meeting Environments&quot;
for Virtual Organisations. We will also continue empirical evaluation
studies informing our design.
