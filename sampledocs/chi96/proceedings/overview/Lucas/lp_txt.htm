<H2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<P>
MAYA Design is a full-service product design consultancy offering 
services at the intersection of computer science, psychology, and 
visual design.  We have developed efficient techniques for facilitating 
interdisciplinary design and for communicating clearly with our clients.

<p>
<H2>DELIVERING USABILITY TO CONSUMERS</H2>
<P>
There is a significant disparity between the state of the art in academic 
usability design and the average level of usability delivered to consumers.  
Despite a clear understanding of how to improve usability, hopelessly 
confusing technology products continue to hit the market daily.  There 
is a solid consensus that interdisciplinary collaboration can vastly 
improve the usability and marketability of complex devices. There 
remains, however, a scarcity of commercial venues  for interdisciplinary, 
user-centered design.
<p>
With the exception of a few superb in-house groups at large technology 
firms, there are very few opportunities in industry for careers that 
focus on meaningful interdisciplinary work.  As a result, the best 
and brightest tend to gravitate toward academic work -- even if their 
interests are fundamentally oriented toward professional practice rather 
than research.
<p>
MAYA Design Group was founded in 1989 to address this problem.  A spin-off 
of Carnegie Mellon University, MAYA was modeled after the great industrial 
design consultancies of the 1930s and 1940s.  But it was built from the 
ground up as a place where engineers, human-factors specialists, graphic
designers, and industrial designers could practice their disciplines in 
deep collaboration (Figure 1). This interdisciplinary collaboration 
allows MAYA to deliver a wide range of strategic, user-centered product-
design services to the technology industries.

complexity

<p>
MAYA specializes in making complicated computer-based products easier 
for average people to use. Our goal is to "tame complexity," not 
necessarily to eliminate it. Our 23-member staff is more-or-less equally 
distributed among the three disciplines of engineering and computer science; 
human factors and cognitive psychology; and industrial and graphic design.  
We work closely with a diverse group of clients, primarily in the 
high-technology industries, augmenting their in-house capabilities with 
our areas of expertise. 
<p>
We encourage clients to view MAYA as a "virtual employee" whom they can 
rely on for assistance throughout the whole product development cycle, 
which includes strategic planning, iterative design, rapid prototyping, 
user testing, and transition to manufacturing.  Even when a project is 
focused on only one or two of our core competencies, our clients benefit  
from the easy communication among our specialists.  For example, our 
graphic design staff would not deliver an icon design that is impossible 
to render given the color-map constraints of the target platform.
<p>
<H2>MAKING COLLABORATION WORK</H2>
<P>
Every area of professional expertise has its own language, values, 
conventions, and perspectives on an issue. This diversity is the core 
value of collaborative process, but it is almost guaranteed to 
promote miscommunication, misperception, and misdirection.  Add to this the 
development agenda and marketing needs of each client, and communication 
becomes a significant bottleneck.  At MAYA, we focus on broadening the 
bandwidth of communication among all concerned, both between MAYA and 
the client, and among the other members of the client's team.
<p>
<h3>A "Show Me" Language</h3> 
<p>
Making ideas concrete is central to MAYA's design approach.  As early as 
possible, and throughout the design process, we use a variety of prototypes, 
depending on the scope of the project, timelines, and our client's 
budgetary constraints.  These prototypes may be as simple as a storyboard, as 
concrete as a physical mock-up, or as detailed as a downsized, but fully 
architected, system. By giving early form to design ideas, prototypes also 
serve as a common language to express function, interaction style, aesthetics, 
and architecture.

<p>
<h3>"Circular" Reasoning</h3>
<p>
Brainstorming among our disciplinary specialists and with our clients is 
key to broadening the bandwidth of communication during a design project.  
MAYA's facilities include our kiva -- a multimedia brainstorming and 
presentation room inspired by the circular underground chambers used by 
the ancient Pueblo Indians (Figure 2).  Our modern kiva has a wraparound 
white board that encourages team members to express their ideas in a 
free-form, non-hierarchical style of interaction. Instead of a fixed 
conference table, small curved tables, custom-designed by MAYA, line the 
perimeter of the room and can be wheeled about to accommodate users' needs.  
Our kiva includes a Macintosh 7100 PowerPC, a BARCO Video/Data large-screen 
projection system, a Panasonic VCR, and a Bose surround-sound system.
<p>
<h3>Breaking Down the Walls</h3>
<p>
Informal communication among disciplinary specialists generates much 
good design. Our engineers, human-factors specialists, and visual designers 
mingle freely in a space configured in the "no walls" tradition of the 
design studio.  Without divisive departments or office doors, our design 
team is free to exchange creative ideas and to discuss issues in a casual, 
uninhibited way.
<p>
<H2>SUPPORTING FACILITIES</H2>
<P>
Our user-studies lab enables us to collect and analyze user data.  The lab 
also supports graphic design, video production, focus groups, and marketing 
presentations.  Through a single computer interface, we can configure and 
control all of the equipment [1].  Our model shop facilitates production of 
prototypes or models of hardware products.  Similarly, our engineering lab 
enables us to develop functional electronic prototypes making effective use 
of inexpensive microcontrollers and embedded systems technologies.
<p>
<H2>SELECTED PROJECTS</H2>
<P>
Working in the domain of Army logistics, MAYA and Carnegie Mellon University 
are developing a prototype software environment for accessing, analyzing, 
and visualizing large amounts of diverse data. Called Visage, this environment 
consists of three primary components:  1) a unique data navigation method 
using drill-down and roll-up techniques for navigating heterogeneous 
databases; 2) an information-centric drag-and-drop user-interface paradigm; 
and 3) the ubiquitous availability of intelligent visualization tools. 
<p>
We are also collaborating with Digital Equipment Corporation to develop a 
clean-slate design for a new generation document-management product called 
Workscape* [2].  The product integrates diverse sources of information into 
a common 3-D display.  
<p>
MAYA also has in its portfolio a diverse collection of physical product 
designs that complement our software design projects.   These designs 
include  control devices for consumer electronics and interactive video, 
the operator interface of a medical ultrasound device, the on-screen menu 
system for TVs and VCRs, and the engineering and industrial design for a 
modular, distributed control and home-automation system. 
<p>
MAYA uses computer-solid-modeling techniques and stereolithography for the 
production of object prototypes and design for manufacture.  For Solotec 
Corporation, MAYA was involved in all phases of the development of an 
innovative snowplow designed to be pushed by an automobile.  3-D computer 
models guided the visual and mechanical design of the product  and were 
complemented by the construction of full-scale functional prototypes used 
for field trials.  MAYA employs similar techniques for most of its 3-D 
products.
