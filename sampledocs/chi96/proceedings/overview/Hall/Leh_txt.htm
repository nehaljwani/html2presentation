<H1>HCI at Banc Sabadell</H1>


<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>
The introduction of HCI to Banc Sabadell is described, providing a brief history. Attempts to
improve application usability and to encourage a focus on HCI issues are detailed. Several
applications are described, identifying the success of the incorporation of HCI at Banc
Sabadell. 
<P>

<H2>INTRODUCTION OF HCI TO BANC SABADELL</H2>
Banc Sabadell is a medium sized Spanish bank, with 400 branches and 4000 employees. The
informatics division has 200 employees, who develop applications and provide user support.
Programming is provided by external companies. 
<P>
Before 1990, there was a reliance on character based interfaces. In 1989, an application with a
graphical interface, BOSS which provides transactional operations, was initiated. In its
pre-introduction phase a human factors evaluation was performed. The resulting savings
highlighted HCI potential and identified a need for HCI expertise. In 1994, an HCI specialist
was employed full-time. Since then, an HCI group, now consisting of 3 people, has evolved
which provides support to Project Heads for usability issues, interface design and identification
of user needs. 
<P>

<H2>BANC SABADELL NEEDS AND REQUIREMENTS</H2>
Banc Sabadell has a dual language policy, and applications are produced in Catalan and
Spanish. In-house development permits the development of customised applications and to
facilitate this we have purchased an interface design tool. 
<P>
Application homogeneity is encouraged to reduce costs of  training, development and
maintenance, demanding HCI group effort in determining how varying  user needs can be
supported with the same application.
<P>

<H2>HCI AND APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT</H2>
Knowledge transfer has been facilitated through producing interface design guidelines, an
important issue as there is little HCI information in Catalan (the informatics division working
language). Interface standards have been produced for applications which use software such as
MicroSoft Access. A BOSS interface generator permits rapid development whilst ensuring
consistency to in-house standards. To ensure high quality graphical design and a consistent
corporate image for our InterNet web, a Page Editor has been developed which has a defined
set of graphical elements and interaction standards. 
<P>
Recent activities include the use of iterative design and rapid prototyping. This enables project
costing to remain acceptable, whilst permitting savings due to usability problem discovery
early in the lifecycle. Prototyping has facilitated communication with users, improving input of
constructive criticism and reducing misunderstandings. 
<P>
Channels for user ideas and improvements are provided through an "Initiative Competition."
Suggestions vary from simple improvements to task structures up to ideas for full scale
projects. Each suggestion is evaluated for improvement in productivity, quality (for clients and
users) and cost-benefits. Users are asked to rank applications monthly, helping to identify
unsuccessful applications which may need usability testing and modification. 
<P>
The HCI group is extending the project lifecycle to include issues such as usability goal setting,
user testing mechanisms and usability problem identification. The emphasis is on incorporating
these as a standardised part of the lifecycle. In-house usability literature is being developed in
Catalan to help Project Heads understand principle themes, concerns and activities.
<P>

<H2>BANC SABADELL APPLICATIONS</H2>
In the past two years a considerable investment has been made for hardware and software.
Users now have high quality software products (word processors, spreadsheets, and electronic
mail). With the realisation of the importance of user needs and product usability, rival
products are now evaluated on these factors. The importance of user training and support has
been acknowledged and has facilitated introduction, acceptance and use of these products. 
<P>
A number of key systems have emerged. BOSS [2] supports almost a 1000 banking operations,
providing the working environment for bank clerks. It has emerged through a significant
evolutionary process, with a human factors heuristic evaluation providing a large number of
modifications to enhance usability. User testing is used to ensure the acceptability of new
operations. 
<P>
SENECA [1] provides a product catalogue and permits simulations. It is used by branch staff
with clients to match client needs to the appropriate product. It has an innovative design,
with an intuitive graphical interface. This application has evolved through extensive usability
testing. It has been ranked by users as our most successful informatics product. 
<P>
MIDAS provides support for Commercial staff and is the first application which has had
significant HCI involvement throughout its lifecycle. This included a prototype as part of the
feasibility study to help illustrate application potential to end and strategic level users. It
enables users to consult information about clients and potential clients; select criteria to
identify potential product buyers; maintain information about clients; and permits effective
time planning through the use of an innovative appointments book. 
<P> 
A highly iterative design approach is being applied to SHIVA, an Executive Information System.
Usability issues are crucial, as users are infrequent and have limited information technology
skills; information is vast and complex; easily usable and understandable navigation is
essential; and optimal task structures are imperative. Its design aims for  maximum usability,
utility and efficiency. 
<P>
The Servidor Documental, an electronic library of manuals, represents an important change in
information access and reduction in paper use. Hypertext links have been incorporated to
enable an increase in speed and facility of use. Due to the regular maintenance of manuals, it
has permitted an annual saving of 20 million pesetas simply in paper costs. It is now in its
pre-introduction phase, following a final usability testing programme. 
<P>
InfoBanc (home banking product) is being updated from a character-based interface using
circular menus to a highly graphical interface with interaction based on direct
manipulation.The main focus of attention for the new version has been on interface and
usability aspects, which are seen as key selling points for home users.
<P>
Banc Sabadell has produced a web as part of the Spanish InfoVia project (Telefonica).
Although this was developed by the Marketing Division, the decision was made to involve the
HCI group to ensure that the pages provided and the manner of interaction was of a high
standard.
<P>

<H2>SUMMARY</H2>
Banc Sabadell has increased the attention paid to HCI. This trend looks set to continue due to
improvements in quality and productivity, and reductions in costs, thus revealing the
importance of HCI to the organization.
