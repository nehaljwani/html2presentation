<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
Software companies are becoming increasingly concerned about producing and selling applications for the home.  But what are those applications?  How do we find out what is needed or desired in the home?  How do we assess the usability and usefulness of applications designed for home users?  This SIG will focus on home studies:  how to do them, who to do them with, how this differs from similar studies in the business world?

<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
Today many software firms do some form of user-centered design and requirements analysis for their business products.  As the computer moves more and more into the home, these software firms are beginning to design products for the home market.  However, the home differs significantly from the business world in the type of applications that are desired Some possible differences might include the social nature of computing, amount of time available for computing, reasons for interacting with technology, tolerance for technical glitches etc.  Moreover, there is much diversity in the types of users found in the home - age, computer ability, interests, social awareness etc.  Therefore, it seems imperative to do user requirements analysis and user-centered design studies for the home market.  There are several issues involved in this.  First, the HCI community is still evolving and defining methods for doing requirements analysis and user-centered design work in the more established business market.   We think it is fair to say that these methods won't succeed in the home.  What are the reasons and what are the options for methodology to elicit this information from the home? Secondly, the business market can often be subdivided into "vertical markets" for the purpose of application definition and design.  Do "vertical markets" exist in the home market and if so, what are possibilities for them?  
<p>
The purpose of this SIG is to gather HCI professionals who are currently studying the home or are interested in studying the home.  The discussion will focus on: the various methods that people have employed, the outcomes in using that particular methodology, issues or models of the home that emerge from these studies, and a discussion of the differences between business and home studies.
<p>
Several possibilities exist as a follow on to this SIG:
<ul>
<li>The formation of an electronic group for further discussion of this topic
<li>A write-up for SIGCHI bulletin on the types of methodologies currently being employed
<li>A more formal presentation for the next CHI conference
</ul>

<h2>Agenda</h2>
<ol>
<li>Survey of the different types of methodologies used, followed by a discussion of each with pros and cons identified
<li>For each of these methodologies, we'll compare its use in home and business areas.
<li>This should lead to a discussion of the differences between home and business studies.
<li>A short discussion of next steps. 
</ol>
