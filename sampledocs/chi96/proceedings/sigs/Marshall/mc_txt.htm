<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
This Special Interest Group (SIG) meeting will allow interested CHI 96 attendees to participate in a community discussion of the results of the one-day workshop entitled "CHI Ten Year View:  Creating and Sustaining Common Ground."
During the workshop, which will occur prior to the SIG meeting, selected CHI professionals will employ scenario development techniques similar to those used for corporate strategic planning [1] to create a set of three alternative future scenarios based on the following questions:
<ul>
<li>What will be the state of the CHI community in the year 2006?
<li>What kind of work will the members of that community be doing?
<li>What will they consider to be the key issues and research questions of the day?
<li>What will be the nature of the social and technological context in which their work will occur?
<li>What kind of educational preparation and work experience will characterize a successful CHI professional?
<li>What body of knowledge and set of skills will form the common ground of the field?
</ul>
These scenarios will then be used to address the question:  How can the CHI community create and sustain common ground today that will help it thrive and and make important contributions in 2006 and beyond?
The SIG discussion of the workshop should be of interest to educators and managers involved in the development of CHI professionals; researchers and practitioners planning for their careers and future programs of work; and members of the CHI community interested in further exploring the conference theme of common ground.

<h2>SIG ACTIVITY PLAN</h2>
The SIG will be scheduled for two hours.  At the beginning of the session, participants from the CHI Ten Year View workshop will spend about 30 minutes describing each of the three scenarios developed in the workshop.  During the next hour, the SIG participants will ask questions, provide comments, discuss their own views of the future, and suggest ways in which the results of the workshop might be put to good use.  Throughout this discussion, SIG participants will be encouraged to relate their insights to the conference theme of common ground.  The SIG organizers will take notes on this discussion for incorporation into documentation of the workshop results (e. g. SIGCHI Bulletin article, Web pages).  Names and contact information for SIG participants will be gathered and posted on the World Wide Web along with a report on the workshop and SIG.  During the last 30 minutes of the SIG, we will discuss ways in which interested participants might be involved in further work with the CHI Ten Year View scenarios.

<h2>SIG GOALS AND EXPECTED RESULTS</h2>
In addition to providing a means for communicating the results of the CHI Ten Year View workshop, this SIG will provide an opportunity for a larger set of conference participants to contribute to refining and extending those results.  It also will provide an opportunity for interested members of the CHI community to further address the focal issue of common ground as a community.
