<H2>PURPOSE</H2>
The Students at CHI SIG provides an open session where all students
attending CHI 96 can meet their peers while discussing graduate
student issues.  The SIG is intended for the participation of graduate
students (beginning through senior), recent graduates, undergraduates,
and friends.

<H2>MOTIVATION</H2>
A CHI conference can be exciting and overwhelming, especially for
students. The student volunteer program and the doctoral consortium
help students meet each other, but many student attendees do not
participate in either of those programs.

<H2>STRUCTURE OF THE SESSION</H2>
The SIG begins with three graduate students presenting brief
talks. Each presentation will last for ten minutes, followed by five
minutes of questions. After the student presentations, there will be
group discussions of graduate student issues. Each segment will use
half of the ninety-minute session.

<H3>Student Presentations</H3>
The presentations will be exceptionally brief overviews of the
students' thesis work (2 or 3 slide summary), followed by somewhat
less brief overviews of a couple of important issues that the students
had to consider, and any words of wisdom they may have for HCI
graduate students. The presentations will be geared towards students
who might not have an advanced knowledge of the speaker's field.
 <P>
The speakers will be borrowed from the CHI 96 doctoral consortium. The
doctoral consortium chairs are being a great help to us by
recommending three speakers from the doctoral consortium participants,
all of whom are doing excellent and interesting thesis work.

<H3>Group Discussions</H3>
After the presentations, the SIG participants will split up into small
groups for discussion. The group size will be small to promote
interaction. If attendance at the SIG is small enough, we will not
need to split up.
 <P>
The groups will be free to discuss any relevant area of interest and
we will provide a list of questions that might get the discussions off
to a good start. Topics will cover graduate student issues and more
general subjects:

<UL>
 <LI>What makes a good proposal or thesis?
 <LI>What makes a good advisor?
 <LI>Is it possible to have outside interests as a graduate student?
 <LI>What work are you doing or interested in doing?
 <LI>Is CHI by definition an interdisciplinary field, or should there
     be a department of CHI at universities?
</UL>

<H2>WHAT TO EXPECT TO GET FROM THE SIG</H2>

We believe that discussion topics related to student issues will be
inherently valuable--especially with the participation of students
from different schools. Another valuable outcome is that participants
will find some familiar faces at this and future CHI conferences,
having met one another at this SIG. To that end we requested a meeting
time on the first or second day of the conference, preferably right
before lunch so that participants can join each other for lunch that
day.
