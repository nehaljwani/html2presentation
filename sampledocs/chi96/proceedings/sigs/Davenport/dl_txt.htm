<h2>Summary</h2>
Customers today demand to receive a quality, usable product.  Companies are finding that their products will not sell unless they have the reputation for being usable.  One way that companies can ensure usable products is through usability evaluations, user involvement, and testing.  A direct result of the need for user-centered design and testing is the challenge of establishing and evolving usability methodology as an integral part of the development process within the corporate environment.  
During this SIG, individuals who have had a direct impact on establishing and growing usability efforts in their companies will share their successes, failures, and lessons learned.
