<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<P>
The User Interface Software Group at CMU is investigating 
ways to make the design, prototyping, and implementation 
of user interfaces substantially easier.  Unlike other user 
interface development environments that deal only with 
widgets like menus, scroll bars and buttons, we concentrate 
on the insides of application windows, which is the part 
that takes most of the programmer’s time to design and 
implement.  Typical applications of the technology include 
visualizations and visual programming environments, 
drawing programs, user interfaces for expert systems, graph 
editors, graphical programming languages, game user 
interfaces, simulation and process monitoring programs, 
user interface construction tools, CAD/CAM programs, etc.
<P>
We have developed two User Interface Development 
Environments.  <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~garnet">Garnet</A> [1]
is in Common Lisp and runs 
under X/11 and Macintosh, and has been available for 
anonymous FTP for about six years.  There are nearly 100 
projects world-wide using Garnet.  To get Garnet, visit 
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~garnet">the Garnet web page</A>.
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~amulet">Amulet</A>
is a new system 
in C++ that runs on X/11, Microsoft Windows NT or 
Windows 95, and the Macintosh.  Amulet incorporates the 
best ideas of Garnet, as well as new innovations such as a 
command architecture that supports better modularization 
and undo [2].  Amulet is also available for anonymous 
FTP, and there are about 10 projects using it.  To get 
Amulet visit 
<a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~amulet">the Amulet web page</A>.
<P>
In developing Amulet, we have three primary goals: the 
first is to make it useful for user interface researchers.  This 
means that Amulet makes it easy to build new kinds of 
interactive tools and new kinds of widgets, investigate new 
constraint solving algorithms, and explore innovative 
interactive technologies.  For example, Amulet is the first 
system to be designed to support multiple constraint 
solvers operating at the same time, so that researchers can 
investigate new solver technologies.  The second goal is to 
be useful for students, which means that the system should
be easy to learn.  Amulet is currently being used by at least 
three courses at two universities.  Finally, we are 
committed to creating tools useful for general developers, 
which means providing sufficient performance, robustness 
and documentation.
<P>
Important features of Amulet include:
<MENU>
<LI>A dynamic, prototype-instance object system that makes 
prototyping easier.

<LI>Constraints integrated with the object system, so any 
value of any object can be computed by a formula which 
is automatically re-evaluated whenever necessary. 

<LI>A high-level object-oriented output graphics model that 
handles automatic refresh of objects when they change.

<LI>A high-level input model that makes it easy to add 
conventional and gestural behaviors to objects.

<LI>Built-in support for undo and help.

<LI>Flexible widgets, such as buttons, menus, scrollbars, text 
input fields and pull-down menus, implemented using 
the Amulet intrinsics, which you can easily parameterize 
or even replace with your own.

<LI>Interactive debugging tools, including an "Inspector."
</MENU>

Amulet is an on-going research project.  In the future, 
Amulet will support 3D, speech, multi-media, multiple 
people operating at the same time, WWW access, extensive 
end-user customization, and interactive, demonstrational 
tools for building interfaces without programming.  This 
special interest group meeting will discuss the present and 
future designs of Amulet.
