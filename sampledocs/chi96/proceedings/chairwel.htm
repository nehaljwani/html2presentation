<H1> Welcome from the Conference Co-Chairs</H1>

The use of computer technolgy is no longer the privilege of an elite few.
Rapid technological progress in fields such as Multimedia, Telecommunications, 
Computer Graphics and Networking is pushing the development of personal and
ubiquitous computing. Computers are becoming increasingly part of everyone's
life. Research and development in these fields focus on the design and 
implementation of advanced technologies. However, they are not primarily 
concerned with how their creations influence, determine, constrain, or 
enhance the way people think, act, work, and collaborate.
<P>
In the light of these rapid changes in technology, it is a continuous 
challenge for the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to
keep its collective eyes on the humans using the technology, and 
understand and design the way that people interact with and via computers.
<P>
Since several different fields and cultures currently see themselves as
advocates for a human-centered view, we are increasingly aware of the
trend toward diversification within HCI. As these CHI 96 Proceedings and 
Companion show, we have contributions from
<UL>
<LI>
different research fields (e.g. Computer Science, Psychology, 
Social Science, Graphics Design, Architecture)
<LI>
different sub-fields (e.g. Multimedia, Computer Graphics, Virtual Reality,
User Interface Technology, CSCW)
<LI>
universities, research laboratories, big and small companies
<LI>
different application fields (e.g. E-Mail, News, World Wide Web, Telephones)
<LI>
different work cultures (e.g. academia, industry; software engineers, 
graphic designers, movie makers, researchers)
<LI>
different parts of the world (North America, Asia, Australia, Europe)
</UL>
focusing at
<UL>
<LI>
different markets (specialized and small, large), and
<LI>
different user groups (e.g. children, everyone, special jobs, special
needs)
</UL>
Common Ground is the theme for CHI 96, emphasizing the need for
identifying and experiencing the commonality between the different views,
fields, and cultures involved in HCI. In his opening address, Herb Clark
discusses the important role of a common ground to facilitate communication
between people, as well as between people and machines. A common ground needs
to be built and maintained in order to keep communication alive.
The same holds for the field of Human-Computer Interaction.
<P>
Many contributions to CHI 96 address the issue of a common ground in HCI.
We encourage the reader of these CHI 96 Proceedings and Companion to do the 
same:  to explore the Common Ground between the different fields and cultures
forming the discipline of Human-Computer Interaction. The challenge is to see 
beyond the obvious differences to an underlying core of shared beliefs and 
experiences. This is the Common Ground that allows us to exchange ideas and 
learn from each other.
